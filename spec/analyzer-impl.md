# Analyzer core — implementation proposal

Status: implementation proposal for phase 2 of [bidirectional-task.md](../bidirectional-task.md). It implements
[`analyzer-core.md`](analyzer-core.md). The spec is normative, and this document does not change it. This document uses
the types of [`ap-impl.md`](ap-impl.md) with the names and the signatures that §2.2 lists. It does not define them
again. JVM only.

Scope: the packages `org.opentaint.dataflow.bidi.engine`, `org.opentaint.dataflow.bidi.driver` and
`org.opentaint.dataflow.jvm.bidi`; the entities, the method analyzer, the pipeline, the scheduling, the driver, the
hand-offs, the confirmation; the interface of phase 3 (the trace resolution of phase 5 is out of scope, §8.2); the test plan.

Language: ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English. Code first.

## 0. Conventions and design decisions

### 0.1 Conventions

| # | Convention |
|---|---|
| C1 | A bare `§n`, in the text and in the code, is a section of this document. A section of another document has the name of that document: `analyzer-core.md` §4.7, `ap-impl.md` §7.3. Exception: in a table column whose header names a document, `§n` is a section of that document. `ap-impl.md` has Part I in §0 to §8 and Part II in §20 to §34. |
| C2 | The rule ids O1–O5, E-1–E-3, P1–P6, Q1–Q4, W1–W3 and B1–B3 are those of `analyzer-core.md`. So a bare W1, W2 or W3 is a rule of the `Work` event (`analyzer-core.md` §6.2). E1–E7 are the events of `ap.md` §5.3. An id of another document has the name of that document: `ap.md` W3 (the field-limit invariant), `ap.md` W6, `interpreter.md` AC4. The ids DD1–DD12 (§0.2) and C1–C3 are local to this document: `ap-impl.md` has its own DD ids, and `ap.md` has its own C ids. |
| C3 | A path of today's code is relative to the repository root, with the abbreviations below. `path:n` is line `n` of that file. A bare `:n` is line `n` of the file that the table row or the enclosing code names. |

| Name | Path |
|---|---|
| `CORE` | `core/opentaint-dataflow-core/opentaint-dataflow/src/main/kotlin/org/opentaint/dataflow` |
| `JVM` | `core/opentaint-dataflow-core/opentaint-jvm-dataflow/src/main/kotlin/org/opentaint/dataflow/jvm` |
| `SAST` | `core/opentaint-jvm-sast-dataflow/src/main/kotlin/org/opentaint` |
| `TEST` | `core/opentaint-dataflow-core/opentaint-dataflow/src/test/kotlin/org/opentaint/dataflow` |

### 0.2 Design decisions

| # | Decision | Reason | Code |
|---|---|---|---|
| DD1 | The new code is in the Gradle modules of today's core (`opentaint-dataflow`, `opentaint-jvm-dataflow`), in new packages (`bidi.*`, `jvm.bidi`). | The new core uses many `internal` declarations and utilities of these modules. The old core stays unchanged, because the prescan runs it. | §1 |
| DD2 | The worklist item is the edge delta `EdgeDelta(premise, node, facts)`. `facts` is one of the three kinds of `ap.md` §7.2 (`Reach`, `FlowTree`, `TaintTree`) and holds the layer. There is no `Edge` class (`ZeroToZero`, `ZeroToFact`, `FactToFact`, `NDFactToFact`): the premise key and the kind replace it. | `analyzer-core.md` §4.3: an item is (premise key, layer, node, conclusions). | §4.1 |
| DD3 | The added facts of one link key (`CallerRef`, link layer, kind, base, and for FLOW the exclusion and the mark exclusion) are ONE `Facts` group in callee coordinates. Its leaves are the added facts. `add` returns the delta: the new links. `LinkIn`, `RunnerPort.link` and `Subscription` carry such a group. The replay and the delivery take the part of the group that satisfies a premise with ONE function, `ApOps.satisfying`. | The tree form of `ap.md` §7. Today `MethodTreeAccessPathSubscription` keeps caller fact trees too. One function for the two paths is P4. | §4.2, §5.3; `ap-impl.md` §5.4, §7.5 |
| DD4 | The engine compares `Facts` by value (`equals` is structural for each kind). TERMINATION needs this in two places: the repeat test of `RuleWorklist` and the inputs of a conjunctive sink. The engine also uses it for the unchanged set, the parts of `NdSummaryJoin`, the AC4 split, the layers of a conjunction input and the record deduplication of the replay. | Each operation makes new objects, and each store has its own node interner (`ap-impl.md` §4.1, §4.5). | §4.3, §4.4, §4.6, §4.9, §5.3 |
| DD5 | A summary with several premises (E6) joins in the `ConjunctionStore` of the caller (`ndJoin`, `NdSummaryJoin`). The analyzer is a thin adapter. The pipeline encoding of this closure is `PipelineNDZ.sysDNz` (`clDNz_iff`; no zero subscription in a join: `clDNz_ndpub_zero_sub`). | `analyzer-core.md` §5.4: both sides of the join are in the caller. `ap-impl.md` §7.10 has the join. | §4.11 |
| DD6 | `MethodContextCache` holds the forms per METHOD KEY (`MethodForms`) and makes one `DirectedForms` per run. The engine has no forms cache of its own. | The call plans and the entry rules read the context of the key (§10 row 2). `ap-impl.md` §23.7, §31.2 cache each form and its reversal. | §3.4 |
| DD7 | The zero rules `zin`, `seed` and `zret` act only on the edge `{zero} → zero` (a REACH on `{zero}`). A backward edge `jb → zero` (a REACH on `{jb}`) only passes over a call. | Lean `Backward.lean:158-180`: these rules read only `{zero} → zero`. A zero rule on `jb → zero` makes a false backward summary, and `persist` makes it a record. | §4.10 |
| DD8 | The source-seed filter and the source hits act only at the source-seed places: a statement summary, `RuleStatement.summary` and a `SOURCES` stage. They never act on an end fact. | `analyzer-core.md` §4.7; `ap-impl.md` §23.1. An end fact has the shape of a source, but it applies as usual. | §4.3, §4.9 |
| DD9 | `JIRBidiAnalysis` uses the `JIRFactTypeChecker` of the prescan (`JIRAnalysisManager.factTypeChecker`). The bidi entry copies the reference before it releases the prescan state. | Its filters do not depend on its state (`ap-impl.md` §25). One instance keeps one set of statistics. | §8.1 |
| DD10 | The test oracle is `NaiveClosure`: the closure of one run, per path, with the guards of the engine. It applies the forms with `FormApplier` over the per-path `ReferenceAlgebra`, and a call plan with the per-path walk `FormsReference.run` and the guards of the engine (`ap-impl.md` §23.3, §23.8; DD12). The schedule fuzzer compares the engine with it. | `analyzer-core.md` §13 item 1: "the naive fixed point of the closure". | §9.2 |
| DD11 | THE KINDS ARE TYPES. The engine reads the kind of a `Facts` only where a rule of `ap.md` §7.2 depends on it: the zero rules on REACH, the requests from FLOW, no FLOW in a restricted run, entry marks on TAINT. Every other place passes `Facts` to an operation of `ap-impl.md` §5, which dispatches on the kind. | `ap.md` §7.2: the kind follows from the premise, and the types enforce `ap.md` W1, W2 and W6. | §4.1 (the table), §4.2, §4.3, §4.10, §7.3 |
| DD12 | ONE IMPLEMENTATION PER RULE PATTERN. From the other parts: `FormApplier` (the three application modes, generic over the fact algebra; `ap-impl.md` §23.3), which the engine runs over `EngineAlgebra` and `NaiveClosure` over `ReferenceAlgebra` (`ap-impl.md` §23.8); `StageKind.originOf` (the `Origin` rule, `ap-impl.md` §23.5); the per-path plan walk `FormsReference.run` of `NaiveClosure` (`ap-impl.md` §23.8); `StandingJoin` (requests × links; `ap-impl.md` §7.10). Here: `RuleWorklist` (the rule order of a boundary, start and end, both directions), `cut` (every field-limit cut, named by its `ap.md` §4.4 row), `forEachSummaryLeaf` (both hand-offs), `fromCallees`, `applyMatch`. | No rule is written twice, so a fix applies everywhere, and the test oracle shares the mode logic with the engine. | §4.3, §4.4, §4.6, §4.8, §5.3, §7.2, §9.2 |

## 2. Reuse map and the names of the other documents

### 2.1 Reuse map

`analyzer-core.md` §8 gives the decisions. The kinds:

| Kind | Meaning |
|---|---|
| REUSE | Import today's class and call it as it is. |
| GENERALIZE | Make today's class generic (a type parameter, an extracted interface), so that the old core and the new core both use it. The old core keeps its behaviour, because the prescan runs it. |
| ADAPT | Copy the algorithm into a new class and change it. The row says what changes. |
| REPLACE | The new core does not use today's class. The new class does its work. |
| REMOVE | The new core has no such function. |

| Today (`path:line`) | Kind | New | What changes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TaintAnalysisUnitRunnerManager` (`CORE/ap/ifds/TaintAnalysisUnitRunnerManager.kt:56`) | ADAPT | `RunManager` (§3.2, §6.4) | Keep: unit routing `getOrSpawnUnitRunner` (:435-440), runner spawn (:458-494), the counter protocol (:496-514 → `InFlight`), the phantom event (:147, :162), the timeout (:174-184), the memory guard (:113-118), the progress log (:166-171, :562-570: the event counts and the memory usage; `RunManager.logProgress`). Remove: `resetApManager` (:127-136), delayed units (:516-529), the sticky `status` (:69), `methodDependencies` (:81), the trace and confirmation calls (:216-425), the language and per-method statistics of the progress log (:572-624). Add: `RunConfig`, one `SupervisorJob` scope per run, the join, the map of `SummaryStorage`s, the first end wins (`status.compareAndSet`). |
| `TaintAnalysisUnitRunnerManager` as the prescan engine (`CORE/ap/ifds/TaintAnalysisUnitRunnerManager.kt:71`, `:79-81`) | GENERALIZE | `releasePrescan()` (§8.1) | one new member: it drops the runners, the unit storages, `methodDependencies` and the AP manager of the prescan. The old core never calls it, so its behaviour does not change. |
| `AnalysisUnitRunnerManager` (`CORE/ap/ifds/AnalysisUnitRunnerManager.kt:10`) | REPLACE | `RunManager.route` | the unknown-unit drop (:41-42) stays |
| `TaintAnalysisUnitRunner` (`CORE/ap/ifds/TaintAnalysisUnitRunner.kt:29`) | ADAPT | `UnitRunner` (§6.1) | Keep: the channel (:75), the priority queue (:74), the loop (:193-263), the quantum `RUNNER_STEPS_QUANT` (:517), `yield`. Change: the events of §5.1; fixed priority keys (`EventComparator` :47-72 reads mutable keys); one `SubscriptionManager` (not :82-83). |
| `AnalysisRunner` (`CORE/ap/ifds/AnalysisRunner.kt:12`) | REPLACE | `RunnerPort` (§3.3) | |
| `MethodAnalyzerStorage` (`CORE/ap/ifds/MethodAnalyzerStorage.kt:8`) | REUSE the pattern | `UnitRunner.analyzers` (§3.3) | the pattern stays: one analyzer per method key, made on demand (:12-13, :15-36, :49-59). The table has one thread (its runner; the driver reads it after the join), so it is a plain `LinkedHashMap`: no `ConcurrentReadSafeObject2IntMap` (`ap-impl.md` §2: the new core does not use it). No `EmptyMethodContext` twin (:38-47) and no empty-method branch (:23-31). The old class stays unchanged for the prescan. |
| `NormalMethodAnalyzer` (`CORE/ap/ifds/MethodAnalyzer.kt:161`) | REPLACE | `RunMethodAnalyzer` (§4) | the patterns stay: `analyzerEnqueued` (:186) → `queued`; drain then flush (:307-317); the unchanged set (:188, :603-607) → the `unchanged` queue of `DeltaWorklist`; summary at an end node (:674-689) |
| `EmptyMethodAnalyzer` (`CORE/ap/ifds/MethodAnalyzer.kt:1395`) | REMOVE | — | an empty method is never analysed and never a callee (`analyzer-core.md` §4.4; `interpreter.md` D28): the call resolver drops it, and a call with no other callee is an unresolved call |
| the liveness check `isReachable` (`CORE/ap/ifds/MethodAnalyzer.kt:296`; `JIRLocalVariableReachability`) | REMOVE | — | the new core drops no fact on a dead local (`analyzer-core.md` §4.3; `ap-history.md` F67). The alias analysis keeps its own inputs, as today. |
| `TimedMethodAnalyzer` (`CORE/ap/ifds/MethodAnalyzer.kt:1581`) | ADAPT | — | not in phase 2: debug only (`DEBUG_ANALYSIS_TIME = false`, :1391) |
| `MethodAnalyzerEdges`, `AccessPathBaseStorage` (`CORE/ap/ifds/MethodAnalyzerEdges.kt:13`, `AccessPathBaseStorage.kt:5`) | REUSE | `MethodEdgeStore` | the structure, in `ap-impl.md` §7.3 |
| `EdgeCollection.UnprocessedEdgeList` (`CORE/ap/ifds/EdgeCollection.kt:10-33`) | ADAPT | the `normal` queue of `DeltaWorklist` (§4.1) | two stacks, the zero-to-zero items first (a REACH on `{zero}`: today the `is Edge.ZeroToZero` test, :24), then LIFO; the item is `EdgeDelta`; no list compression (trees are interned) |
| `EdgeCollection.EdgeSet` (`CORE/ap/ifds/EdgeCollection.kt:177-181`) | ADAPT | the set of the `unchanged` queue of `DeltaWorklist` (§4.1) | `ObjectOpenHashSet<EdgeDelta>`; it lives until the `unchanged` queue is empty, not for one `Work` event (today :312-313 resets it at the event end) |
| `Edge` (`CORE/ap/ifds/Edge.kt`) | REPLACE | `PremiseKey` + `EdgeDelta` with the kinds `Reach`, `FlowTree`, `TaintTree` | DD2: `ZeroToZero` is REACH; `ZeroToFact` and a concrete `FactToFact` are TAINT; an abstract `FactToFact` is FLOW; `NDFactToFact` is TAINT on a `PremiseSet` (`ap.md` §7.2, §7.6) |
| `SummaryEdgeStorageWithSubscribers` (`CORE/ap/ifds/SummaryEdgeSubscription.kt:742`) | ADAPT | `SummaryStorage` (§5.2) | Keep: the `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` of subscribers (:752), insert then notify (:771-796), `subscribeOnEdges` (:910-912). Change: a lock on the read (P3; today the reads :914-992 take no lock); one index by premise member. |
| `MethodSummariesUnitStorage` (`CORE/ap/ifds/MethodSummariesUnitStorage.kt:10`) | ADAPT | `RunManager.summaryStorage` | the `computeIfAbsent` (:112-115) per method key, with no unit indirection |
| `SummaryEdgeSubscriptionManager` (`CORE/ap/ifds/SummaryEdgeSubscription.kt:23`) | ADAPT | `SubscriptionManager` (§5.3) | Keep: register on the first `getOrPut` (:29-34), the delta insert, the replay (:51-180), the match at delivery (:499-623). Change: one `matches` (P4), one manager per runner. |
| `CommonAPSub`, tree sub-storages (`CORE/ap/ifds/access/common/CommonAPSub.kt:15`, `access/tree/MethodTreeAccessPathSubscription.kt:115-197`) | ADAPT | `CalleeSubscriptions` (§5.3) | Keep: one merged caller tree per caller key, the delta on insert (`mergeAddDelta`, :148; now `AddedFactStore.add`). Replace: `AccessTreeIndex` (:199-283; literal accessors, the bypass under `INDEX_LIMIT = 10` :211-213, :235) by `PathTrie` over the leaf keys and `ApOps.satisfying`. |
| side-effect requirements and summaries, `TaintMarkFieldUnfoldRequest`, `MethodSideEffectSummaryHandler`, `triggerSideEffectRequirement` | REMOVE | the requests (§4.8) | |
| `ExternalMethodTracker` (`CORE/ap/ifds/taint/ExternalMethodTracker.kt`) | REUSE | `UnresolvedCallObserver` (`ap-impl.md` §28.5), called by the plan runner (§4.5) | today once per fact at an unresolved call (`JIRMethodCallFlowFunction.kt:285-295`) |
| fact-depth delay (`MethodAnalyzer.kt:204-206`, `:560-595`, `:1390`; `TaintAnalysisUnitRunner.kt:343-362`) | REMOVE | the field limit | |
| `InitialFactAbstraction` (`MethodAnalyzer.kt:173`) | REMOVE | `ApOps.policy`, `ApOps.emit` (§4.2) | |
| `MethodSummaryEdgeApplicationUtils`, `MethodCallSummaryHandler` | REPLACE | `ApOps.applySummary` + the plan runner | |
| `TaintSinkTracker`, the buckets of `TaintAnalysisUnitStorage` (`CORE/ap/ifds/taint/TaintAnalysisUnitStorage.kt:17-31`) | REPLACE | `ConcurrentVulnerabilityStore`, `ConjunctionStore` (`ap-impl.md` §7.12, §7.10) | no lossy merge: the store merges only the witnesses of one (key, alternative, method key, run, shape) (`ap-impl.md` §7.12) |
| `MethodCallResolver`, `JIRMethodCallResolver` (`JVM/ap/ifds/analysis/JIRMethodCallResolver.kt:36`) | ADAPT | the `Callees` stage of `CallPlan` | in `ap-impl.md` §28.4 |
| `TrackerWithSubscriber`, `JIRLambdaTracker` (`CORE/util/TrackerWithSubscriber.kt:5`, `JVM/ap/ifds/JIRLambdaTracker.kt:8`) | REUSE | `JIRAnalysisManager.prescanLambdas()` (`ap-impl.md` §31.1) | `forEachRegisteredValue` (:23-25) reads the prescan values |
| `MethodEntrypointResolver`, `UnitResolver`, `LanguageManager` (`CORE/ap/ifds/analysis/MethodEntrypointResolver.kt:7`, `CORE/ifds/UnitResolver.kt:21`, `CORE/ap/ifds/LanguageManager.kt:8`) | REUSE | `SharedObjects`, `RunMethodContext` | `getCallExpr` (:13) finds the call statements |
| `ApplicationGraph.reversed` (`CORE/graph/BackwardGraphs.kt:40-45`), `MethodInstGraph` (`CORE/graph/MethodInstGraph.kt:10`) | REUSE | `RunMethodContext.graph` | through `JIRMethodEntry.graph(direction)` (`ap-impl.md` §31.2) |
| `JIRMethodAnalysisContext` (`JVM/ap/ifds/analysis/JIRMethodAnalysisContext.kt:19`) | ADAPT | `MethodContextCache` + `RunMethodContext` (§3.4) | split into the cached part and the run part; the JIR content is in `ap-impl.md` §31 |
| `JIRAnalysisManager` (`JVM/ap/ifds/analysis/JIRAnalysisManager.kt:59`) | GENERALIZE | `prescanRuleIds()`, `releasePrescan()` (§8.1) | `relevantRuleIds` (:75) is private today; `prescanLambdas()` over `contexts` (:76) is in `ap-impl.md` §31.1; `releasePrescan()` clears `contexts` |
| `MemoryManager`, `Cancellation`, `RefManager` (`CORE/util/MemoryManager.kt:17`, `CORE/util/Cancellation.kt:5`, `CORE/util/RefManager.kt:6`) | REUSE | `RunManager`, `UnitRunner`, `ApManager` | one `MemoryManager` per run; each `RunManager` activates the `Cancellation` in its constructor (§3.2); `ApManager` takes the same `RefManager` for its soft trie tables (`ap-impl.md` DD5; §8.1) |
| `UnitRunnerStats`, `MethodStats`, `collectMethodStats` (`CORE/ap/ifds/UnitRunnerStats.kt:7`, `:9`) | REMOVE | `InFlight.handled` (§6.3) | today the progress job reads runner-local state from another thread; the new progress log reads only atomic counters |
| summary serialization (`storeSummaries`, `loadSummariesFromRunner`) | REMOVE | the records | |
| `trace/*` | REMOVE | the SIMPLE trace (§8.1) | the trace resolution is out of scope (`analyzer-core.md` §9): no store of a run stays for a trace resolver (§7.7, §8.2) |
| `TaintAnalyzer.analyzeStaged` (`SAST/common/sast/dataflow/TaintAnalyzer.kt:118-131`) | ADAPT | §8.1 | phase 3; a sketch only |

### 2.3 Additions to `analyzer-core.md` §10

The engine types of this document are those of `analyzer-core.md` §10, with these additions:

| Addition | Spec form | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `RunEvent.LinkIn(callee, ref, linkLayer, added: Facts)`, `RunnerPort.link(callee, ref, linkLayer, added)` | `LinkIn(callee, link: Link)`, `link(callee, link)` | DD3: one event carries the new links of one link key as one group. |
| `Subscription(callee, ref, linkLayer, added: Facts, zeroOnly)` | `addedFact: Pattern` | DD3. |
| `matches(sub, pub, m, ops, mode): Facts?` | `matches(sub, pub, config): Boolean` | DD3: the result is the satisfying part of the group for premise member `m`. |
| `SinkEdge(premise, layer, facts: Facts)` (`ap-impl.md` §7.12) | `SinkEdge(premise, layer, fact: Pattern)` | the triggered part (`MarkCheck.Holds.facts`) of one input: several sink facts in one edge; the leaves are the facts of the spec |
| `SummaryApplier.applySummary(part, pub, member)` | `applySummary(sub, pub)` | E6: the index of the member that the part satisfies (§4.11). |
| `SummaryStorage.candidates(part, mode): List<Pair<Publication, Int>>` | `candidates(a: Pattern, config)` | DD3: the input is a tree part; each candidate has its member index. |
| `RunResult.direction`; `RunResult.analyzers: List` | no such field; `Sequence` | the hand-off and `persist` read the direction. The driver reads `analyzers` more than once. |
| `InFlight.handled`, `InFlight.pending` | none | the progress log reads only these atomic counters (§3.2, §6.3) |
| `IterationPolicy.timeout(run, remaining)`, default `remaining` | none | the budget of one run (§10 row 3) |
| `IterationDriver(policy, shared, budget)` | `IterationDriver(policy, shared)` | the budget of the analysis |
| `BidiEntry` (`gather`, `run`, `toVulnerabilities`, `status`) | none (`analyzer-core.md` §9 names the inputs and the output) | the phase-3 hook of `TaintAnalyzer` (§8.1) |
| `RunnerPort.onProcess`, `RunnerPort.onCut` | none | test hooks: the fuzzer records the processed items (§9.2); `CutPointTest` records each cut with its point (§9.1). They are null in production. |
| `Cut`, `EngineAlgebra` | none | DD12 |
| `SubscriptionPort`, `SummaryApplier`, `ProtocolSteps` | parts of `RunnerPort` | `SubscriptionManager` reads only `SubscriptionPort`. The fuzzer defers the replay and the notification through `ProtocolSteps` (§9.2). |
| `RunnerPort.shared`, `forms`, `subscriptions` | `interpreter`, `contexts`, `vulnerabilities` | the shared objects in one value; the forms of the run (DD6) |
| `MethodContextCache(interpreter, source)`: `forms(key)`, `graph(key, direction)`, `directed(direction)` | `get(method, direction)` | DD6. The JIR source is `JIRMethodContextCache`. |
| `SeedIndex.allowsSource(method, statement, forward)` | none | the source-seed filter of `analyzer-core.md` §4.7 |
| `SharedObjects.unresolvedObserver` | none | the external method tracker (`ap-impl.md` §28.5); the plan runner calls it (§4.5) |
| `RunConfig.mode`, `RunConfig.seededSources`, `Publication.layer` | none | values that the spec fields give |

### 3.3 `UnitRunner`, `RunnerPort`, the analyzer table

```

THE ANALYZER TABLE is the pattern of `MethodAnalyzerStorage` (`CORE/ap/ifds/MethodAnalyzerStorage.kt:12-13`, `:15-36`,
`:49-59`): one analyzer per method key, made on demand. It has ONE thread: its runner writes and reads it, and the
driver reads it only after the join (`RunManager.run`). So it is a plain `LinkedHashMap`, not the
`ConcurrentReadSafeObject2IntMap` of today (`ap-impl.md` §2: the new core does not use that map). The old class stays
unchanged for the prescan. No method key is an empty method (§3.4), so the table has no empty-method branch.

### 3.4 `MethodContextCache` (`analyzer-core.md` §4.8)

The CACHED part holds the per-method entries and the per-key `MethodForms` of `ap-impl.md` §31.2 (DD6). There,
`FormsCache` keeps each form and its reversal, so the engine has no forms cache of its own. The RUN part is
`RunMethodContext`: the `DirectedForms` of the run and the method graph in the direction of the run.

```kotlin
/** The language part of the cache: JVM/bidi/JIRMethodContextCache.kt (below). */
interface MethodContextSource {
    fun forms(key: MethodKey): MethodForms                              // ap-impl.md §31.2: JIRMethodEntries.forms(interp, key)
    fun graph(key: MethodKey, direction: Direction): MethodInstGraph    // ap-impl.md §31.2: JIRMethodEntries[key].graph(direction)
}

/** analyzer-core.md §4.8, the CACHED part. Analysis lifetime. */
class MethodContextCache(val interpreter: Interpreter, private val source: MethodContextSource) {
    fun forms(key: MethodKey): MethodForms = source.forms(key)
    fun graph(key: MethodKey, direction: Direction): MethodInstGraph = source.graph(key, direction)
    /** analyzer-core.md §4.9, the table "What the core uses in each direction" (ap-impl.md §23.7). One per run. */
    fun directed(direction: Direction): DirectedForms = DirectedForms(interpreter, direction, ::forms)
}

/** analyzer-core.md §4.8, the RUN part: made by the run, bound to it. RunMethodAnalyzer holds one until freeze (§4.11). */
class RunMethodContext(val key: MethodKey, val forms: DirectedForms, val config: RunConfig, val shared: SharedObjects) {
    /** analyzer-core.md §4.4: an empty method (no instruction) has no method key. The call resolver drops it from the
     *  callees (interpreter.md D28), and it is never a root. So every method here has a graph and an edge store. */
    private val graph: MethodInstGraph = shared.contexts.graph(key, config.direction)  // wired backward (analyzer-core.md §4.4)
    private val ends: Set<CommonInst> = forms.endNodes(key).toHashSet()
    /** analyzer-core.md §4.3: forward, the exit rules of an exceptional exit apply there, but it is not an end node (no

## 4. `RunMethodAnalyzer` (`analyzer-core.md` §4)

One class in one file (`RunMethodAnalyzer.kt`). The subsections show its members in parts; every member belongs to
`RunMethodAnalyzer`, except the top-level types that a comment names.

### 4.1 State (`analyzer-core.md` §4.1)

```kotlin

    private val r: RunMethodContext get() = rctx!!
    private val config: RunConfig get() = r.config                // the demand and the seeds of the run: dropped by freeze
    private val forms: DirectedForms get() = r.forms              // DirectedForms of the run (ap-impl.md §23.7)
    private val ops = port.shared.ops                             // analysis lifetime

    private val applier = FormApplier(EngineAlgebra())             // the three application modes (ap-impl.md §23.3)

    private var worklist = DeltaWorklist()                        // the two queues and the set of the unchanged path (below)
    private var pending = ArrayList<Publication>()                 // analyzer-core.md §4.6 item 3
    var queued = false; private set                               // analyzer-core.md §6.2 (MethodAnalyzer.kt:186)
    var steps = 0L; private set                                   // the priority key (§6.2); only this runner reads it
    val hasZeroWork: Boolean get() = worklist.hasZeroWork          // the priority key (§6.2)
```

The worklist item and the worklist (DD2; `analyzer-core.md` §4.3, §10; ADAPT of `EdgeCollection.UnprocessedEdgeList`
and of the unchanged set, `MethodAnalyzer.kt:188`, `:603-607`):

```kotlin
/** DD2: the facts BEFORE the statement of `node`. `facts` holds the kind and the layer (ap.md §7.2). Value equality (DD4). */
data class EdgeDelta(val premise: PremiseKey, val node: CommonInst, val facts: Facts) {
    val zeroToZero: Boolean get() = premise.isZero && facts is Reach          // today the `is Edge.ZeroToZero` test (EdgeCollection.kt:24)
}

/** analyzer-core.md §4.3 THE TWO QUEUES. `unchanged`: the items of the unchanged path (ap.md §8.1), which do not go
 *  through edges.add; its SET drops a repeat. `normal`: the deltas of edges.add, the zero-to-zero items first, then LIFO
 *  (as today). The step takes an `unchanged` item while that queue is not empty, and a `normal` item only when it is
 *  empty. The set goes when the step finds `unchanged` empty: after the last `unchanged` item put its successors into the
 *  queues. So a loop of statements that do not touch a base ends (the set holds the items of the loop), and the set stays
 *  across the end of a Work event. */
class DeltaWorklist {
    private val unchanged = ArrayList<EdgeDelta>()
    private var seen = ObjectOpenHashSet<EdgeDelta>()            // the set of `unchanged` (DD4: by value)
    private var zeroUnchanged = 0                                // the zero-to-zero items in `unchanged`
    private val zero = ArrayList<EdgeDelta>()                    // `normal`: the zero-to-zero items
    private val other = ArrayList<EdgeDelta>()                   // `normal`: the other items

    val isEmpty: Boolean get() = unchanged.isEmpty() && zero.isEmpty() && other.isEmpty()
    /** A zero-to-zero item in either queue: the priority of the runner (§6.2) and the W2 test of `work` (§4.3). */
    val hasZeroWork: Boolean get() = zero.isNotEmpty() || zeroUnchanged > 0
    val size: Int get() = unchanged.size + zero.size + other.size

    /** A delta of edges.add (the `normal` queue). */
    fun add(d: EdgeDelta) { if (d.zeroToZero) zero += d else other += d }

    /** An item of the unchanged path. False: a repeat that the set holds; the item does not go into the queue again. */
    fun addUnchanged(d: EdgeDelta): Boolean {
        if (!seen.add(d)) return false
        unchanged += d
        if (d.zeroToZero) zeroUnchanged++
        return true
    }

    /** `unchanged` first. When the step finds `unchanged` empty, the set goes (a new empty set), and a `normal` item
     *  comes next. */
    fun removeNext(): EdgeDelta {
        unchanged.removeLastOrNull()?.let { if (it.zeroToZero) zeroUnchanged--; return it }
        if (seen.isNotEmpty()) seen = ObjectOpenHashSet()
        return zero.removeLastOrNull() ?: other.removeLast()
    }
}
```

A repeat that comes after the worklist became empty, while the set still holds the items of the last drain, gives
nothing new: its application gives only repeats (`edges.add`, the conjunction inputs, the witnesses and the source hits
deduplicate). So the set is exact.

THE KINDS IN THE ENGINE (DD11). The kind follows from the premise (`ap.md` §7.2), so the engine reads it where a rule
depends on it, and nowhere else. Every other place passes `Facts` to an operation of `ap-impl.md` §5:

| Rule of the kinds (`ap.md` §7.2) | Code |
|---|---|
| the zero-to-zero items go first (in the `normal` queue) | `DeltaWorklist`: `EdgeDelta.zeroToZero` (`premise.isZero && facts is Reach`) |
| the zero rules `zpass`, `zin`, `seed`, `zret` read REACH; a backward `{jb} → zero` only passes | `runCall`: `c is Reach` → `zeroAtCall` (§4.10) |
| every request comes from a FLOW fact (a premise with the mark `*`) | `raise` (§4.3): `check(input is FlowTree && premise is InitialAp)` |
| a restricted run has REACH and TAINT only | `emit` (§4.2): a `FlowTree` added fact is an error; `checkKinds` (in `push`, `summaryDelta`) asserts it |
| an ND edge (a `PremiseSet` premise) is always TAINT; no member is the zero fact (`ap.md` §4.6) | `checkKinds` (§4.3); `ndMatch` (§4.11); `ApManager.union` drops the zero fact |
| a FLOW part never meets a TAINT summary, and the application raises no request | `matches` → `satisfying` (§5.3); `applyParts` (§4.6) |
| E6 conclusions are TAINT (`ap.md` §4.6, `ap.md` W7); E6 never takes the zero subscription | `ndMatch`, `applyCombination(g: TaintTree)` (§4.11) |
| a zero-premise conclusion is REACH or a TAINT source result; only a TAINT one carries entry marks | `endAt` step 4 (§4.7) |
| the demand of each kind in the hand-offs | the table of §7.3 |

### 4.3 The application modes, the field limit, the step (`analyzer-core.md` §4.3)

ONE FORM APPLIER (DD12). `ap-impl.md` §23.3 gives the three application modes of a `StatementSummary`, and
`FormApplier` (`ap-impl.md` §23.3, §23.8) writes them once, generic over a `FactAlgebra`. Each application gets a `Place`
(the node, the static exception of a statement micro edge, a source-seed place). The engine gives `EngineAlgebra`
(below): the trees of `ap-impl.md` §4 through `ApOps`. `NaiveClosure` gives the per-path `ReferenceAlgebra` of
`ap-impl.md` §23.8 (§9.2). So the test oracle and the engine share the mode logic and differ only in the fact algebra.
`FormApplier.stage` gives each result with the micro edge that made it (null: a conjunction); the plan runner reads the
`Origin` from it (§4.5). At a source-seed place `FormApplier` calls `allowsSource` before the micro edge and `sourceHit`
after a result, before any `edges.add` (`analyzer-core.md` §4.7).

The engine algebra, its `ApOut` and the field limit:

```kotlin
    /** The engine side of FormApplier (ap-impl.md §23.3): the trees of ap-impl.md §4 through ApOps. A micro edge goes
     *  through the public ApOps.applyEdge (ap-impl.md §5.3; inside it, the internal `applyCompiledEdge` is the tree form
     *  of the delta-concat of ap.md §4.1). */
    private inner class EngineAlgebra : FactAlgebra<PremiseKey, Facts> {
        override fun base(c: Facts) = c.base
        override fun filter(c: Facts, filter: TypeFilter) = ops.filter(c, filter)
        override fun applyEdge(me: MicroEdge, c: Facts, premise: PremiseKey, statementEdge: Boolean, out: ResultSink) =
            ops.applyEdge(c, premise, me.edge, statementEdge, mode, collect(premise, c, out))
        override fun conjunction(cj: ConjunctiveEdge, premise: PremiseKey, c: Facts, node: CommonInst, out: ResultSink) =

            !config.seededSources || config.seeds.allowsSource(key, node, me.forward)
        override fun sourceHit(node: CommonInst, me: MicroEdge) { sourceHits?.add(key, node, me.forward) }
    }

    }

    /** ap.md §4.5, §4.10: EVERY REQUEST COMES FROM A FLOW FACT (ap.md §7.2): the mark gate, a sink, a literal and a
     *  cleaner `part` raise one only on an abstract mark. A FLOW fact has one premise with the mark `*` (a policy fact or

        addRequest(premise, kind)
    }

    /** THE FIELD LIMIT (ap.md §4.4). Every cut of the engine is a call of this helper, and `point` names the cut point.
     *  ap-impl.md §5.7 has the table: the cut point, its call site, what it cuts, and where a fact can exceed L. A REACH
     *  passes; a tree within L passes in O(1) (`boundedDepth`). */
    private fun cut(point: Cut, premise: PremiseKey, f: Facts, sink: ResultSink) {

```

```kotlin
/** Top level. The cut points of ap.md §4.4: one value per call site of `cut` (the table below). */
enum class Cut { STATEMENT, CALL, ENTRY_RULES, EXIT_RULES, SEED }
```

Every call of `cut`, with its row of `ap.md` §4.4. `ap-impl.md` §5.7 gives, per row, what is cut and where a fact can
exceed `L` before the cut:

| `ap.md` §4.4 row | `Cut` | Call site |
|---|---|---|
| the statement transfer, after the micro edges and the lhs type filter; the read sources | `STATEMENT` | `runStatement` (§4.3), after the result filters |
| the call return, after the rewriter, the binding back and the aliases (a summary, a record, the unresolved callee) | `CALL` | `flow` at the exit point of the plan (§4.5): ONE site for every result of a call |
| the source results and the end facts of a sink at a call, after their binding back and the aliases | `CALL` | the same site |
| the results of the entry rules at the method start | `ENTRY_RULES` | `RuleWorklist` of `startAt` (forward, §4.4); backward, of `endAt` (the reversed entry rules, §4.7) |
| the results of the exit rules at an exit, normal or exceptional | `EXIT_RULES` | `RuleWorklist` of `endAt` (forward, both exits, §4.7); backward, of `startAt` (the reversed exit rules, §4.4) |
| the conjunction result; the application of a summary with several premises (E6) | `STATEMENT`, `CALL` | a conjunction of a statement: `runStatement`; of a stage (an ND source; a pass rule never makes one, `interpreter.md` §4.2) and E6 (`applyCombination`, §4.11): the plan exit |
| the backward seed | `SEED` | `fireSinkSeeds` (§4.9); a seed at a call is cut again at the plan exit (no change) |

The conjunction of a statement or of a stage (`ap.md` §4.6, §8.9). The literal check is `checkMark` (`MarkCheck`, `ap-impl.md`
§5.8), the same check as a sink:

```kotlin
    /** ap.md §4.6: one input per literal that `c` matches; each NEW full combination gives the target (a TAINT tree) with

     *  So a conjunction of a `{zero}` input and an `{i}` input gives an `{i}` edge. The caller cuts the result
     *  (Cut.STATEMENT or Cut.CALL). */
    private fun conjunction(cj: ConjunctiveEdge, premise: PremiseKey, c: Facts, node: CommonInst, sink: ResultSink) {
        val store = conjunctions!!
        for ((k, lit) in cj.literals.withIndex()) {

            }
            for (layer in listOfNotNull(Layer.NORMAL.takeIf { holds.normalPart }, Layer.DEMAND.takeIf { holds.demandPart }))   // ND.conjLayer
                for (comb in store.add(cj, node, cj.literals.size, k, ConjunctionStore.Input(premise, layer)))

### 4.4 The rule order of a boundary; start nodes and start rules (`analyzer-core.md` §4.4)

ONE RULE WORKLIST (DD12) runs the rule order of a method boundary in both directions. Users: `startAt` (forward the
entry rules; backward the reversed exit rules and the exit sink seeds) and `endAt` (§4.7: forward the exit rules at both
exits; backward the reversed entry rules).

```kotlin
    /** THE RULE ORDER OF A BOUNDARY (interpreter.md §4.3, §4.7; reversed: analyzer-core.md §4.4, interpreter.md §4.9).
     *  1. each input goes through the rule summary (STATEMENT: it passes or keeps; the sources add);
     *  2. forward, each item meets the sinks, and the end facts of a triggered sink (GEN on the zero fact, in the layer of
     *     the sink edge) re-enter as items; backward, the reversed end facts (GEN) apply to each item.
     *  Every result is cut at `point`. `after` sees each item with its triggers (endAt: steps 3 to 5).
     *  TERMINATION (DD4): `seen` compares (PremiseKey, Facts) by VALUE. Every step makes new objects, and an end fact can
     *  trigger its own sink again; with identity equality the loop does not end. */
    private inner class RuleWorklist(private val rules: RuleStatement, private val node: CommonInst, private val point: Cut) {
        val items = ArrayList<Pair<PremiseKey, Facts>>()
        private val seen = HashSet<Pair<PremiseKey, Facts>>()
        private val add: ResultSink = { pr, x -> cut(point, pr, x) { p2, t -> if (seen.add(p2 to t)) items += p2 to t } }

        /** Step 1. The Place: in run 1 the static exception of ap.md §4.10 item 1 acts at the entry and exit rule
         *  statements; a source here is at a source-seed place. NaiveClosure.boundary uses the same Place (§9.2). */
        fun input(premise: PremiseKey, f: Facts) =
            applier.statement(rules.summary, premise, f, Place(node, config.run1, sources = true), sink = add)

        fun drain(after: (PremiseKey, Facts, Triggers) -> Unit = { _, _, _ -> }) {
            var k = 0
            while (k < items.size) {
                val (pr, t) = items[k++]
                val tr = checkSinks(pr, node, t, rules.sinks)                                 // step 2 (NONE backward)
                for ((sink, layer) in tr.fired) applier.gen(sink.endFacts, ap.zero, Reach.of(layer), add)
                if (!forward) applier.gen(rules.endFacts.edges, pr, t, add)                      // the reversed end facts
                after(pr, t, tr)
            }
        }
    }

    /** E3 at one start node. Forward: the entry rules (interpreter.md §4.3: the zero keep, the context filter, the
     *  entry-point sources, the entry sinks) on the start fact. Backward: the reversed exit rules of THAT exit, normal or
     *  exceptional, on the start fact and on each sink seed of the exit sinks of that exit (§4.9). A seed enters where the
     *  forward exit sink checks (interpreter.md §4.7 step 2), so the reversal of step 1 applies to it: the reversed exit
     *  sources (a source hit) and the reversed end facts (interpreter.md §4.9 SEEDS; analyzer-core.md §4.4). */
    private fun startAt(premise: PremiseKey, n: CommonInst, start: Facts) {
        val w = RuleWorklist(forms.startRules(key, n), n, if (forward) Cut.ENTRY_RULES else Cut.EXIT_RULES)
        w.input(premise, start)
        if (!forward && premise.isZero) fireSinkSeeds(n) { seed -> w.input(ap.zero, seed) }   // rule seed
        w.drain()
        for ((pr, t) in w.items) edges.add(n, pr, t)?.let { push(EdgeDelta(pr, n, it)) }
    }
```

The entry sinks are unconditional (`interpreter.md` §4.1): they trigger only on the zero fact. So step 2 on the other
items of the start (the source results, the end facts) finds nothing, as the entry order of `interpreter.md` §4.3 says.

### 4.5 The call plan runner (`analyzer-core.md` §4.5)

One algorithm for both directions. The plan is a DAG of six points. `flow` takes the facts at a point through every
stage that starts there (`CallPlan.stagesFrom`). A fact at the exit point is cut and goes to the return node. The
reversed plan (`ap-impl.md` §23.6) is the same data: entry `AFTER`, exit `BEFORE`, no guard, no filter, and the
`PASS_OVER` stage `AFTER → BEFORE` of the alias bases. The runner applies it as every other stage.

```kotlin
    /** Facts at a point of a plan. `origin` (ap-impl.md §23.5 Origin): where a forward fact at REWRITTEN comes from; null before. */

        }
    }
```

`FormApplier.stage` (`ap-impl.md` §23.3) gives each result with the micro edge that made it, so the plan runner reads the
`Origin` with no second edge loop. The `Origin` rule is `StageKind.originOf` (`ap-impl.md` §23.5): the engine and the
per-path walk `FormsReference.run` (§9.2) call the same code.

### 4.6 The results of the callees stage (`analyzer-core.md` §4.2 `applySummary`, `applyRecord`)

The end point of the callees stage is `RETURNED` forward and `ADDED` backward. A result at an end node of the run goes
through the end rules there (`emitAfter`), also when the end node is a call (`analyzer-core.md` §4.3).

### 4.7 End rules, summary edges, publications (`analyzer-core.md` §4.6)

`DirectedForms.endRules` gives an `ExitRules` in both directions (backward: the reversed entry rules, no global-state
rule, no entry marks; `ap-impl.md` §23.7). Forward, it gives the exit rules of each exit, normal or exceptional
(`interpreter.md` §4.7; at the exceptional exit the rule position `Result` reads `exc`). So `endAt` is the
`RuleWorklist` of §4.4 plus steps 3 to 5:

```kotlin
    /** interpreter.md §4.7 forward; the reversed entry rules backward. Then the summary edges (analyzer-core.md §4.6).

### 4.8 Requests (`analyzer-core.md` §4.6; `ap.md` §4.5, §4.10)

Both sides of the join are in one analyzer (§4.2: `addLink`, `addRequest`). It is a STANDING JOIN: a request stands for
the whole run, and a link that comes later meets it too. The engine uses the standing-join utility of `ap-impl.md`
§7.10, in its two-type form `StandingJoin<A, B>` (`newA`, `newB`; `KaryJoin` is the k-ary form over one type). The two Part I stores
are the sides: they deduplicate (E-3) and they are the indexes. `ap-impl.md` §5.10 gives the action of one pair:

```kotlin
    /** E2, E5, E7 (ap.md §8.8; Store `standing_complete`). A side: requests (RequestStore) or links (AddedFactStore). */
    private var requestJoin: StandingJoin<Pair<InitialAp, RequestKind>, Link>? = if (!config.run1) null else StandingJoin(
        nearB = { (i, kind) -> when (kind) {                                                   // the links that a new request meets
            is RequestKind.Mark -> links.overlapping(i.base, i.path)
            is RequestKind.Position -> links.overlapping(AccessPathBase.ClassStatic, kind.path)   // the match reads (S, p)
        } },
        nearA = { link -> requests!!.overlapping(link.addedFact) },                              // the requests that a new link meets
        meet = { (i, kind), link -> act(i, kind, link.addedFact, link.caller) })

    private fun act(i: InitialAp, kind: RequestKind, a: Pattern, caller: CallerRef) =
        when (val x = ops.requestAction(i, kind, a, caller)) {
            is RequestAction.Answer -> addInitial(x.initial)                                 // a new initial fact (E3)
            is RequestAction.Climb -> p.send(RunEvent.RequestIn(caller.caller, x.premise, x.request))   // to the caller
            RequestAction.None -> Unit
        }
```

`freeze` drops `requestJoin` with `requests` (§4.11).

### 4.9 Sinks, witnesses, seeds, source hits (`analyzer-core.md` §4.7)

```kotlin
    /** The result of the sink check of one place: the triggered (sink, layer) pairs, and the EVALUATED parts: every part on
     *  which a pattern of a sink holds, also when a conjunctive sink has no full combination yet (endAt step 3). */
    private class Triggers(val fired: List<Pair<SinkRule, Layer>>, val parts: List<Facts>) {
        operator fun plus(o: Triggers) = Triggers((fired + o.fired).distinct(), parts + o.parts)
        companion object { val NONE = Triggers(emptyList(), emptyList()) }
    }

    /** ap.md §4.9, §8.9, §8.10. Forward only: the backward run has no sink check. The check of one literal is checkMark
     *  (ap-impl.md §5.8), the same check as a conjunction literal (§4.3).
     *  THE GLOBAL-STATE RULE (analyzer-core.md §4.7; interpreter.md §4.7 step 3): `parts` gets the part of EVERY literal

     *  so a later item can complete the combination with it (ap-history.md F67). */
    private fun checkSinks(premise: PremiseKey, node: CommonInst, c: Facts, sinks: List<SinkRule>): Triggers {
        if (!forward || sinks.isEmpty()) return Triggers.NONE
        val fired = ArrayList<Pair<SinkRule, Layer>>()

                    fired += s to m.facts.layer
                } else for (comb in conjunctions!!.add(s, node, s.patterns.size, k,      // per alternative (s), statement, literal;
                        ConjunctionStore.Input(premise, m.facts.layer, m.facts))) {     // the evaluated part is the input.
                                                                                        // TERMINATION: Input is compared by

                    witness(s, node, comb.inputs.map { SinkEdge(it.premise, it.layer, it.facts!!) })   // one witness per sink edge set
                    fired += s to comb.layer
                }
            }
        }
        return Triggers(fired.distinct(), parts)
    }

    /** ap.md §8.10; analyzer-core.md §4.7. THE KEY is (rule, method, statement) with the METHOD of the method key, without

     *  §7.12): witnesses of two alternatives or two method keys never merge, so no merge sees two group keys. */
    private fun witness(s: SinkRule, node: CommonInst, edges: List<SinkEdge>) =
        r.vulnerabilities.add(VulnerabilityKey(s.rule, key.method, node),
            SinkWitness(s.alternative, key, edges, config.index, s.endFacts.map { it.edge.to }))

    /** ap.md §9.2 rule seed: where the zero fact reaches `node`, Zero → requirement (a TAINT fact: the seed has a
     *  concrete mark), cut by the field limit. */
    private fun fireSinkSeeds(node: CommonInst, emit: (Facts) -> Unit) {
        for (seed in config.seeds.at(key, node)) if (seed is Seed.Sink)

    }
```

`targetTree` puts an `[any]` requirement in the demand layer (`ap.md` W6). The rules of `analyzer-core.md` §4.7 are in
this code:

| Rule | Code |
|---|---|
| a witness per sink edge or per sink edge set; the key without the context; the witness names its alternative and its method key | `checkSinks` → `witness` |
| the global-state rule: every evaluated static goes; a conjunctive sink stores it as the literal input | `checkSinks` (`parts`, `ConjunctionStore.Input.facts`) → `endAt` step 3 (§4.7) |
| exit sinks at both exits; no summary at an exceptional exit (`analyzer-core.md` §4.3) | `exitRulesAt` → `endAt(summary = false)` (§4.3, §4.7) |
| sink seed at a call | `zeroAtCall` (§4.10) → `fireSinkSeeds` → `flow(BOUND)` |
| sink seed of an exit sink, at a normal or an exceptional exit | `startAt` (backward, zero premise): then the reversed exit rules of that exit (§4.4) |
| source seed filter | `FormApplier` (`ap-impl.md` §23.3) → `EngineAlgebra.allowsSource` at a source-seed place: a statement summary, `RuleStatement.summary`, a `SOURCES` stage (DD8; `ap-impl.md` §23.1) |
| source hit before `edges.add`, also for a duplicate zero result | `FormApplier` → `EngineAlgebra.sourceHit`, after `applyEdge` produced, before any `edges.add` |
| the end facts are not sources | `FormApplier.gen`, and the `END_FACTS` stage with `sources = false` |
| no sink check backward | `checkSinks` returns at once |

### 4.10 The zero fact at a call (`analyzer-core.md` §4.5; rules `zpass`, `zin`, `zret`)

```kotlin
    /** `item.facts` is REACH (ap.md §7.2): the zero fact. */
    private fun zeroAtCall(item: EdgeDelta, ctx: CallCtx) {
        emitUnchanged(item)                                    // never touched: it passes (zpass; rule pass for any premise)
        // DD7, Lean Backward.lean:158-180: zin, seed and zret read ONLY the edge {zero} -> zero. A backward `jb -> zero`
        // (a reversed source or end fact reached the zero fact, ap.md §7.2) only passes over the call. The forward run has
        // no other REACH edge.
        if (!item.premise.isZero) { check(!forward); return }
        if (forward) {                                                                   // BIND_IN has `zero.* -> zero.*`:
            flow(ctx, ctx.plan.entry, listOf(PlanFact(item.premise, item.facts, null)))  // sinks, sources, ADDED (ap-impl.md §28.7)
            return
        }
        val seeds = ArrayList<PlanFact>()
        fireSinkSeeds(item.node) { t -> seeds += PlanFact(ap.zero, t, null) }           // a zero-to-fact edge (rule seed)
        if (seeds.isNotEmpty()) flow(ctx, CallPoint.BOUND, seeds)                        // then the reversed BIND_IN
        val ref = CallerRef(key, ap.zero, ctx.callerLayer, item.node)
        for (m in ctx.plan.callees?.callees.orEmpty()) {
            p.subscribe(Subscription(m, ref, ctx.callerLayer, item.facts, zeroOnly = true))   // zret: zero-premise publications
            p.send(RunEvent.ZeroIn(m))                                                   // zin
        }
    }
```

The `zret` application is the `part.zeroOnly` branch of `applySummary` (§4.6): the conclusion itself, at `ADDED`, with
the zero premise of the caller.

### 4.11 Summaries with several premises (E6, `analyzer-core.md` §5.4)

The join is `ConjunctionStore.ndJoin` of `ap-impl.md` §7.10 (DD5): one `NdSummaryJoin<Subscription>` per
`NdKey(callee, premise key, layer of the publication, call statement)`. `NdSummaryJoin` is a `KaryJoin` (`ap-impl.md`
§7.10). The analyzer is a thin adapter:

```kotlin
    /** A part satisfies member `m` of `pub` (a part goes under EVERY index that it satisfies: `matches` is called per
     *  index). First the new part with every stored conclusion, then the new delta with every full combination. No member
     *  of a PremiseSet is the zero fact (ap.md §4.6), so a zero subscription never satisfies one and never comes here. */
    private fun ndMatch(part: Subscription, pub: Publication, premise: PremiseSet, m: Int) {
        check(!part.zeroOnly && part.added !is Reach && !premise.member(m).isZero)    // E6 never takes the zero subscription
        val conclusion = checkNotNull(pub.conclusion as? TaintTree) { "an ND edge is TAINT (ap.md §4.6)" }
        val join = conjunctions!!.ndJoin<Subscription>(ConjunctionStore.NdKey(part.callee, premise, pub.layer, part.ref.call))
        for ((combo, g) in join.addSubscription(m, part)) applyCombination(combo, premise, g)
        for ((combo, g) in join.addConclusion(conclusion)) applyCombination(combo, premise, g)
    }

    /** One full combination and one conclusion. The result premise is the union of the caller premise sets, ApManager.union:
     *  it drops the zero fact, so it is `{zero}` only if every caller premise is `{zero}` (ap.md §4.6). The conclusion of an
     *  ND summary is a TaintTree (ap.md §4.6, ap.md W7; NdSummaryJoin gives TaintTree values, ap-impl.md §7.10), so no
     *  request comes from it. The results are cut at the plan exit (Cut.CALL, ap.md §4.4 row 6). */
    private fun applyCombination(parts: List<Subscription>, premise: PremiseSet, g: TaintTree) {
        val union = parts.map { it.ref.premise }.reduce(ap::union)
        fromCallees(parts[0].ref) { results ->                          // one call statement (the key)
            ops.applyCombination(parts.mapIndexed { k, s -> s.added to premise.member(k) }, g, mode,
                collect(union, g) { pr, t -> results += PlanFact(pr, t, Origin.SUMMARY_EFFECT) })
        }
    }

    /** analyzer-core.md §7.6: the run ended. The stores stay until the driver drops the RunResult after the barrier (§7.7):
     *  the links (the confirmation), the summaries (`persist`, the hand-off), the source hits (backward). The run machinery
     *  and the run context (its RunConfig: the demand, the seeds, the record view) go now. No handler runs after it. */
    fun freeze() {
        port = null; rctx = null; worklist = DeltaWorklist(); pending = ArrayList()
        requests = null; requestJoin = null; conjunctions = null
    }
}   // end of RunMethodAnalyzer
```

THE ZERO FACT IN E6. No member of a `PremiseSet` is the zero fact: a conjunction drops it from the union of the premise
sets (`ap.md` §4.6; `analyzer-core.md` §5.4). So the zero subscription never takes part in E6 (`ndMatch` asserts it),
and `matches` gives null for a REACH part and a member that is not zero. The backward run has no summary with several
premises (`ap.md` §9.2).

P3 alternative: the writer publishes an immutable snapshot of `deltas` and `byMember` with a volatile write; the reader
reads the snapshot with no lock. The first implementation uses the lock.

### 5.4 P1–P6 in the code

| P2 | insert before notify | `SummaryStorage.publish`: `synchronized(lock) { published.addAll }`, then `steps.notify { for (s in subscribers) ... }` |
| P3 | linearizable read | `SummaryStorage.candidates`: `synchronized(lock) { published.candidates(...) }` |
| P4 | one match function, complete candidates | `applyMatch` (the one call of `matches`) in `replay` and in `onDelivery`; `PublicationIndex.candidates`, `CalleeSubscriptions.candidates` (the table of `analyzer-core.md` §5.3) |
| P5 | no removal | `subscribers`, `parts`, `index`, `deltas` only grow; `RunManager.run` drops them after the join |
| P6 | match at delivery | `onDelivery` reads `byCallee` when the runner handles the `Delivery` |
| E-3 | exact deduplication | `links.add`, `CalleeSubscriptions.add` (exact `AddedFactStore`), `requests.add`, `initials.add`; `edges.add` also subsumes |

## 6. Scheduling (`analyzer-core.md` §6)

### 6.1 The runner loop

The loop of today (`TaintAnalysisUnitRunner.kt:193-263`). The changes: the events of §5.1, the shared `handle`, fixed
priority keys, `Work` into the local queue (W1), and the catch of `Cancellation.Cancelled`.

```kotlin
    // UnitRunner
    suspend fun runLoop() = coroutineScope {
        var events = 0
        while (isActive) {
            if (queue.isEmpty()) queue.add(channel.receive())                     // today :196-198
            while (true) queue.add(channel.tryReceive().getOrNull() ?: break)     // today :200-203
            val event = queue.poll()!!
            val ended = try { handle(event) }                                     // EventDispatch.kt
                catch (e: Cancellation.Cancelled) {                               // a checkpoint of the ApManager or the alias
                    check(run.ended) { "a cancel with no end" }                   // analysis: RunManager.fail set the status
                    return@coroutineScope                                         // first; the run keeps the status of its cause
                }
            if (ended) run.inFlight.afterHandler()                                // Q2: after the handler and its sends
            else queue.add(event)                                                 // W2: still counted; a new fixed key
            if (event is RunEvent.Work || ++events >= RUNNER_STEPS_QUANT) { events = 0; yield() }   // today :205-208
        }
    }
```

`Cancellation.Cancelled` is a `CancellationException` (`CORE/util/Cancellation.kt:6`), so the
`CoroutineExceptionHandler` of `RunManager.start` never sees it. EVERY CANCEL HAS A KNOWN CAUSE (`analyzer-core.md`
§6.3): the timeout of the run (`fail(TIMEOUT)` in `RunManager.run`) or the memory guard (`fail(OOM)`, the
`MemoryManager` callback). `RunManager.fail` sets the status first, then cancels and completes the run together. So
the runner only stops: the run keeps the status of its cause, and `run.ended` is true (the `check`). There is no
external cancel.

A `Work` event runs at most `RUNNER_STEPS_QUANT` steps. It also stops when the zero-work state of the analyzer changes.
Then the analyzer goes back into the queue with a new key. Both rules are as today (`TaintAnalysisUnitRunner.kt:217-221`).

### 6.2 The local queue with fixed keys

```kotlin
/** The local priority queue. The key of an event is computed ONCE, when the event enters the queue
 *  (analyzer-core.md §6.1). The order of today (EventComparator, TaintAnalysisUnitRunner.kt:47-72): analyzers with
 *  zero-to-zero work, then other events, then analyzers with fewer steps. */
class EventQueue {
    private class Entry(val event: RunEvent, val rank: Int, val steps: Long, val seq: Long)
    private val heap = PriorityQueue(compareBy<Entry>({ it.rank }, { it.steps }, { it.seq }))
    private var seq = 0L

    fun add(e: RunEvent) {
        val (rank, steps) = when (e) {
            is RunEvent.Work -> (if (e.analyzer.hasZeroWork) 0 else 2) to e.analyzer.steps
            else -> 1 to 0L
        }
        heap.add(Entry(e, rank, steps, seq++))
    }
    fun poll(): RunEvent? = heap.poll()?.event
    fun isEmpty(): Boolean = heap.isEmpty()
}
```

### 6.3 `InFlight` and local work

```kotlin
/** analyzer-core.md §6.2, §10. One per run (Q4). `onZero` is the quiescence: RunManager sets the status there by
 *  `compareAndSet(null, COMPLETE)`, so the first end of the run wins (§3.2). */
class InFlight(private val onZero: () -> Unit) {
    private val count = AtomicLong(0)
    private val handledCount = AtomicLong(0)                              // the progress log only
    val pending: Long get() = count.get()
    val handled: Long get() = handledCount.get()
    fun beforeSend() { count.incrementAndGet() }                          // Q1
    fun afterHandler() { handledCount.incrementAndGet(); if (count.decrementAndGet() == 0L) onZero() }   // Q2
}
```

| Rule | Code |
|---|---|
| Q1 increment before send | `UnitRunner.post`, `UnitRunner.enqueue`; `RunManager.route` counts only when a runner exists |
| Q2 decrement after the handler | `runLoop`: `afterHandler()` after `handle` returns true; `InFlight.handled` counts it for the progress log |
| Q3 guard during the start | `RunManager.run`: `beforeSend()` before the `Start` events, `afterHandler()` after |
| Q4 one counter per run | `RunManager.inFlight`; a new `RunManager` per run; the join (§6.4) stops old runners |
| W1 `queued`, then `Work` | `RunMethodAnalyzer.requestWork`, called by `push` (every `normal` add), by `emitUnchanged` (every new `unchanged` item) and by `summaryDelta` (a pending publication), also from `addLink`, the replay and a request answer |
| W2 back to the local queue, still counted | `work` returns false; `runLoop` re-adds it with no `afterHandler` |
| W3 end only when empty and flushed | `work`: `flushPublications()`, then `queued = false`, then true |

### 6.4 Abnormal end, the run scope, the join

| `analyzer-core.md` §6.3 rule | Code |
|---|---|
| status `COMPLETE`, `TIMEOUT`, `OOM`, `FAILED` | `RunStatus`; `RunManager.fail` |
| the first end wins | `RunManager.status`: the quiescence (`InFlight` zero) does `compareAndSet(null, COMPLETE)`; `fail` does `compareAndSet(null, s)`; `run` reports `status.get()` |
| every cancel has a known cause: the timeout or the memory guard | `RunManager.run`: `fail(TIMEOUT)`; the `MemoryManager` callback: `fail(OOM)`; `runLoop` catches `Cancellation.Cancelled` and only stops (§6.1) |
| the `Cancellation` is activated when the run is made | `RunManager.init` (§3.2), before the driver publishes the manager |
| no run after an incomplete run; the incomplete run adds nothing | `IterationDriver.analyze` returns the report of the earlier complete runs (§7.1) |
| a `SupervisorJob` scope per run | `RunManager.job`, `scope`; a failed runner calls `fail(FAILED)`; it cannot cancel a later run |
| join every runner; a runner that does not stop stops the analysis | `RunManager.stopAndJoin`; false: `run` reports `FAILED` and gives no analyzers (§3.2) |
| cancel and complete together | `RunManager.fail`: `cancellation.cancel()` and `completion.complete(s)` |

No external cancel exists: the timeout of a run and the memory guard are the only causes of a cancel, and both end
the run through `RunManager.fail` with their own status. The driver starts no run after an incomplete run (§7.1). A
run that the memory guard ends before its start routes no `Start` event (§3.2). The constructor of `RunManager` activates the
`Cancellation` before the driver publishes the manager, so no activation undoes a cancel.

---

## 7. The driver (`analyzer-core.md` §7)

### 7.1 `IterationDriver`, `IterationPolicy`

    }
}
```

THE END OF THE ANALYSIS (`analyzer-core.md` §7.1). Each `return` of `analyze` sets `Report.end`:

| Return | `AnalysisEnd.status` | `reason` |
|---|---|---|
| the stop rule after a complete forward run | `COMPLETE` | `STOP_RULE` |
| `continueAfter` is false after a complete forward run | `COMPLETE` | `POLICY` |
| an incomplete run, forward or backward | its status: `TIMEOUT`, `OOM`, `FAILED` | `ABNORMAL` |
| an exception at the barrier, also a failed `require` of `HandOff.next` (`ap.md` W3) | `FAILED` | `ABNORMAL` |

`run` and `direction` are those of the last run. In every case the report holds the results of the complete forward
runs before the end (§7.6). So the iteration ends only after a forward run, as `PipelineDriver.driver_iteration_upto`
asks, or at an abnormal end.

    }
```

The driver persists the records of each complete run at the barrier (§7.1). The records are not a hand-off
(`analyzer-core.md` §1).

### 7.3 Backward run `n + 1` → forward run `n + 2` (`analyzer-core.md` §7.4)

```kotlin
    /** Lean Backward.demOf; FSeeds.srcHit. */
    private fun toForward(result: RunResult, shared: SharedObjects): Pair<DemandStore, SeedIndex> {
        val demand = DemandStore.Builder(shared.ap)                                 // 1: (zero, none) is implicit (ap-impl.md §7.7)
        forEachSummaryLeaf(result, shared.ops) { m, jb, leaf ->                    // the edges at the forward entry
            demand.add(m, when (jb) {
                is InitialAp -> if (jb.isZero) DemandPattern(leaf, null)             // 2: (gb, none)
                                else DemandPattern(leaf, jb.toPattern())             // 3: (gb, jb)
                is PremiseSet -> error("the backward run has no ND summary (ap.md §9.2)")
            })
        }
        val seeds = ArrayList<Seed>()
        for (a in result.analyzers) for ((m, s, e) in a.sourceHits!!.entries()) seeds += Seed.Source(m, s, e)   // ap.md §8.11
        return demand.build() to SeedIndex.of(seeds)
    }
}
```

Case 3 with `gb` the zero fact is `(zero, jb)`: it restricts the zero-premise summaries of the forward run. It needs
the edge `jb → zero` in the backward edge store (`ap-impl.md` §7.3 keeps a REACH bit per premise key).

THE KINDS IN THE HAND-OFFS (`ap.md` §7.2). The demand patterns come from the leaves of each kind:

| Run | Summary kinds | Demand |
|---|---|---|
| forward run 1 | FLOW (`*` premise), TAINT (`{zero}`: a source; a concrete premise), REACH (`{zero} → zero`) | one pattern per (leaf, member). REACH gives `(zero, zero)`: it adds nothing to the implicit zero demand, because the emission of the zero fact is the zero fact and the backward `{zero}` summaries are not restricted (§4.7) |
| forward run ≥ 3 | TAINT, REACH (a restricted run is concrete) | the same rows without FLOW |
| backward | TAINT (`{zero}`: from a seed; `{jb}`), REACH (`{zero} → zero`; `{jb} → zero`: a requirement reached a source) | TAINT: `(gb, none)` or `(gb, jb)`. REACH on `{zero}`: `(zero, none)`, the implicit zero demand (`DemandStore.Builder` drops it). REACH on `{jb}`: `(zero, jb)`, case 3 |

### 7.4 `Seed`, `SeedIndex`

```kotlin
/** analyzer-core.md §10, unchanged. RuleId = CommonTaintConfigurationSink (ap-impl.md §7.12). */
sealed interface Seed {
    val method: MethodKey
    val statement: CommonInst
    data class Sink(val rule: RuleId, override val method: MethodKey, override val statement: CommonInst,
                    val requirement: Pattern) : Seed
    data class Source(override val method: MethodKey, override val statement: CommonInst, val edge: PathEdge) : Seed
}

/** analyzer-core.md §10, plus the source test of analyzer-core.md §4.7 (§2.3). */
class SeedIndex(private val byPlace: Map<Pair<MethodKey, CommonInst>, List<Seed>>) {
    private val sources: Set<Triple<MethodKey, CommonInst, PathEdge>> =
        byPlace.values.flatten().filterIsInstance<Seed.Source>().mapTo(HashSet()) { Triple(it.method, it.statement, it.edge) }

    fun at(method: MethodKey, statement: CommonInst): List<Seed> = byPlace[method to statement].orEmpty()
    fun allowsSource(method: MethodKey, statement: CommonInst, forward: PathEdge): Boolean =
        Triple(method, statement, forward) in sources

    companion object {
        val EMPTY = SeedIndex(emptyMap())
        fun of(seeds: List<Seed>) = SeedIndex(seeds.groupBy { it.method to it.statement })
    }
}
```

### 7.5 `Support` and the confirmation (`analyzer-core.md` §7.5)

The support is a property of a premise SET in one METHOD KEY. It is the least fixed point over the links of the run.
The links carry the data (E-2): `Link(addedFact, linkLayer, CallerRef(caller, premise, callerLayer, call))`. The driver
computes it at the barrier; no store of a run keeps it (`analyzer-core.md` §7.5). So `InitialFactStore` (`ap.md` §8.2)
has no field for the supported premise sets: the confirmation reads `Support`.

```kotlin
/** ap.md §4.9 condition 3 (Lean Confirmed.Sup, RExact.SupM, NDConfirmed.SupN). */
class Support(private val result: RunResult, roots: List<MethodKey>, shared: SharedObjects) {
    private data class Site(val callee: MethodKey, val caller: MethodKey, val call: CommonInst)
    private val roots = roots.toHashSet()
    private val ap = shared.ap
    private val zeroKey: PremiseKey = ap.zero                                            // ap.md §7.1: the InitialAp is the key
    private val atSite = HashMap<Site, HashMap<Pattern, MutableList<PremiseKey>>>()   // normal links: added fact → caller premises
    private val sitesOf = HashMap<MethodKey, MutableSet<Site>>()
    private val fedBy = HashMap<Pair<MethodKey, PremiseKey>, MutableSet<Site>>()       // (caller, caller premise) → sites
    private val questions = HashMap<MethodKey, MutableSet<PremiseKey>>()               // the caller premise sets of m's own links
    private val sup = HashSet<Pair<MethodKey, PremiseKey>>()

    init {
        for (callee in result.analyzers) for (link in callee.links.links()) {
            val ref = link.caller
            if (link.linkLayer != Layer.NORMAL || ref.callerLayer != Layer.NORMAL) continue   // 3.2.2, the normal caller edge
            val site = Site(callee.key, ref.caller, ref.call)
            atSite.getOrPut(site, ::HashMap).getOrPut(link.addedFact, ::ArrayList) += ref.premise
            sitesOf.getOrPut(callee.key, ::HashSet) += site
            fedBy.getOrPut(ref.caller to ref.premise, ::HashSet) += site
            questions.getOrPut(ref.caller, ::HashSet) += ref.premise
        }
        val work = ArrayDeque<Pair<MethodKey, PremiseKey>>()
        for (r in this.roots) if (sup.add(r to zeroKey)) work += r to zeroKey               // 3.1
        while (work.isNotEmpty()) {
            val q = work.removeFirst()
            for (site in fedBy[q].orEmpty()) for (p in questions[site.callee].orEmpty())
                if ((site.callee to p) !in sup && suppliedAt(site, p.members)) {            // 3.2
                    sup += site.callee to p; work += site.callee to p
                }
        }
    }

    /** 3.2: ONE call statement supplies every member: the member is zero or exact concrete, a normal link has an added
     *  fact EQUAL to it (3.2.3), and the caller premise set of that link is supported (3.2.1). Different members can use
     *  different caller edges (a tree). Lean Confirmed.Sup.call, RExact.SupM.call, NDConfirmed.SupSlots.cons. */
    private fun suppliedAt(site: Site, members: Collection<InitialAp>): Boolean {
        val byFact = atSite[site] ?: return false
        return members.all { j -> exactOrZero(j) && byFact[j.toPattern()].orEmpty().any { (site.caller to it) in sup } }
    }

    /** ap.md §4.9 condition 2: the member is the zero fact or an exact concrete fact. Users: suppliedAt, confirm. */
    private fun exactOrZero(j: InitialAp) = j.isZero || (j.tail == Tail.EXACT && j.mark is MarkSlot.Concrete)

    fun isSupported(m: MethodKey, members: Collection<InitialAp>): Boolean =
        (m in roots && members.all { it.isZero }) || sitesOf[m].orEmpty().any { suppliedAt(it, members) }

    /** analyzer-core.md §7.5 step 2. A sink edge set is confirmed as a whole: the union of its premise sets (without the
     *  zero fact, ap.md §4.6), jointly. A witness reads the support IN ITS OWN METHOD KEY (`w.methodKey`): the
     *  vulnerability key has no context. A merged entry of ap-impl.md §7.12 has one premise set and one layer per
     *  literal, so it is confirmed exactly when each of its witnesses is. */
    fun confirm() {
        for ((_, w) in result.vulnerabilities.witnessesOf(result.runIndex)) {
            val members = w.supportPremise(ap).members                         // ap.md §4.6: the union drops the zero fact (ap-impl.md §7.12)
            w.confirmed = w.edges.all { it.layer == Layer.NORMAL } &&                                   // condition 1
                members.all(::exactOrZero) &&                                                              // condition 2
                isSupported(w.methodKey, members)                                                        // condition 3
        }
    }
}
```

The fixed point reads only the caller premise sets (`questions`). `isSupported` checks a witness at the end. A pair
enters `sup` only after its callers: so `sup` is the least fixed point. Each pair enters `work` once.

### 7.6 `Report`

```kotlin
enum class ReportState { CONFIRMED, DEMAND }
enum class EndReason { STOP_RULE, POLICY, ABNORMAL }

/** analyzer-core.md §7.1: the end of the analysis. `run`, `direction`: the last run (the table of §7.1). */

     *  alternative, any method key); the first run that confirms it stays. The demand set replaces the old one: a demand
     *  key of an earlier run that this run does not report is refuted (ap.md §8.10). */
    fun add(config: RunConfig, result: RunResult) {
        val next = LinkedHashMap<VulnerabilityKey, Report.Entry>()
        for ((key, ws) in result.witnessesByKey())
            if (ws.any { it.confirmed }) confirmed.putIfAbsent(key, Report.Entry(key, ReportState.CONFIRMED, config.index, ws))
            else next[key] = Report.Entry(key, ReportState.DEMAND, config.index, ws)
        demand = next                                                             // one step (analyzer-core.md §7.5 step 3)
    }

    /** One key from several runs: CONFIRMED wins (ap.md §8.10). */
    fun build(end: AnalysisEnd): Report = Report(confirmed.values + demand.values.filter { it.key !in confirmed }, end)
}
```

### 7.7 What stays after a run, as code (`analyzer-core.md` §7.6)

| Data | Stays until | The reference that holds it | Where it is dropped |
|---|---|---|---|
| run summary stores; `sourceHits` of a backward run | its hand-off | `RunResult.analyzers[*].summaries`, `.sourceHits` | the local `result`, at the next loop iteration of `IterationDriver.analyze` |
| links of a forward run | its confirmation | `RunResult.analyzers[*].links` | the same |
| edges and initials of a run | the end of its barrier | `RunResult.analyzers[*]` | the same: no store of a run stays for a trace resolver (§8.2) |
| the stores of an incomplete run | the end of `RunManager.run` | — | `RunManager.run` gives no analyzers for it (§3.2) |
| `SummaryStorage`, `SubscriptionManager`, runners | the end of the run | `RunManager.storages`, `.runners` | `RunManager.run`: `runners.clear(); storages.clear()` |
| worklist, pending, requests and the request join, conjunctions (with the E6 joins), the port | the end of the run | `RunMethodAnalyzer` fields | `RunMethodAnalyzer.freeze()` |
| the witnesses of the reported keys | the end of phase 3 | `Report.Entry.witnesses` | the caller drops the `Report` |
| `RecordStore`, `VulnerabilityStore`, `MethodContextCache` (the entries and forms of `ap-impl.md` §31.2), `ApManager` | the analysis | `SharedObjects` | `JIRBidiAnalysis.run` returns (`SharedObjects.close()` closes the pool) |

---

## 8. Phase 3 and phase 5

### 8.1 The phase-3 entry: `JIRBidiAnalysis`

THE PRESCAN STATE (`analyzer-core.md` §9 PRESCAN MEMORY). The bidi entry first gathers the prescan values: the prescan
rule ids, the prescan lambdas, the fact type checker (DD9) and the external method tracker. Then the caller releases
the WHOLE prescan state before run 1: the prescan runners, the unit storages, the analyzers, the AP manager of the
prescan and `JIRAnalysisManager.contexts`. Today `fullScan` only resets them (`resetApManager`, `TaintAnalyzer.kt:154`)
and keeps the runners, and the bidi path does not call `fullScan`. The GENERALIZE members below do it. The old core
never calls them, so its behaviour does not change:

```kotlin
// CORE/ap/ifds/TaintAnalysisManager.kt: one new member, a no-op by default.
    /** Phase 3: drop the method contexts of the prescan, after the bidi entry copied the prescan values. */
    fun releasePrescan() {}

// JVM/ap/ifds/analysis/JIRAnalysisManager.kt: two new members. ap-impl.md §31.1 adds prescanLambdas().
    /** The reduced rule set of the prescan (relevantRuleIds :75). */
    fun prescanRuleIds(): Set<String> = relevantRuleIds.toSet()

    /** The contexts of the prescan (:76): their alias analyses, liveness and lambda trackers. Call it only after
     *  prescanLambdas(). factTypeChecker (DD9) and externalMethodTracker stay. */
    override fun releasePrescan() = contexts.clear()

// CORE/ap/ifds/TaintAnalysisUnitRunnerManager.kt: one new member. `activeApManager` (:71) becomes nullable, and
// `apManager` (:72) reads `activeApManager!!` (the old core always sets it first, :128).
    /** Phase 3: the whole prescan engine state goes. resetApManager (:127-136) resets the runners and keeps them; this
     *  drops them. A runner that did not stop in the prescan keeps only its own state, until it ends. */
    fun releasePrescan() {
        runnerForUnit.clear()                       // the runners: queues, subscriptions, method analyzers (:79)
        unitStorage.clear()                         // the summaries and the vulnerabilities of the prescan (:80)
        methodDependencies.clear()                  // :81
        activeApManager = null                      // the AP manager of the prescan and its interners (:71)
    }

How `TaintAnalyzer` calls it in phase 3 (a sketch; `SAST/common/sast/dataflow/TaintAnalyzer.kt:118-131`):

```kotlin
    /** Phase 3. JIRTaintAnalyzer gives its JIRBidiAnalysis; null: the old full scan. */
    open fun bidiEntry(): BidiEntry? = null

    private fun analyzeStaged(entryPoints: List<Method>): Pair<List<VulnerabilityWithTrace>, Status> {
        val analysisStart = TimeSource.Monotonic.markNow()
        val startMethods = entryPoints.map { MethodWithContext(it, EmptyMethodContext) }
        prescan(startMethods)                                        // the old core, unchanged (:133-146)
        val bidi = bidiEntry() ?: return fullScan(analysisStart, entryPoints, startMethods)   // today (:148-224)
        bidi.gather(analysisManager, startMethods)                   // 1: the prescan values (analyzer-core.md §9)
        analysisManager.releasePrescan()                             // 2: then the WHOLE prescan state goes: the contexts,
        ifdsEngine.releasePrescan()                                  //    the runners, the unit storages, the AP manager
        val report = bidi.run(options.ifdsTimeout - analysisStart.elapsedNow())
        return bidi.toVulnerabilities(report) to Status(bidi.status(report), TaintAnalysisUnitRunnerManager.Status.OK)
    }

    // JIRTaintAnalyzer. `ifdsAnalysisGraph` (TaintAnalyzer.kt:60-62) becomes protected. `bidiPolicy` is a new constructor
    // parameter (null: the old full scan); the production policy is a phase-3 option (analyzer-core.md §0).
    override fun bidiEntry(): BidiEntry? = bidiPolicy?.let { policy ->
        JIRBidiAnalysis(cp, ifdsAnalysisGraph as JApplicationGraph, analysisUnit, taintConfig, analysisParams, policy,
            refManager, cancellation)
    }
```

The trace resolution status is `OK`: phase 3 resolves no trace. The CWE filter of today (`TaintAnalyzer.kt:191-198`)
applies to the output, as in `fullScan`.

### 8.2 The phase-5 read API: out of scope

The trace resolution is out of scope (`analyzer-core.md` §9 TRACE). The core keeps no store of a run for a trace
resolver: the driver drops the stores of each run after its barrier (§7.7), and the report holds only the witnesses of
its keys (`Report.Entry.witnesses`, §7.6). The phase-3 output gives each CONFIRMED vulnerability the SIMPLE trace of
today (§8.1). This document gives no read API for a trace resolver.

## 9. Test plan (`analyzer-core.md` §13)

### 9.1 Test classes and the TDD order

Tests use `kotlin.test` as today. The engine tests are in `TEST/bidi/engine/`, the driver tests in `TEST/bidi/driver/`,
the JVM tests in `opentaint-jvm-dataflow/src/test/.../jvm/bidi/`. Test fixtures (test-only, this document):

* `ApFixtures`: patterns to `InitialAp` (`ApManager.initial`), `Facts` of each kind (`Reach.of`; `ApOps.startFact` of
  a `*` premise for FLOW; `ApOps.targetTree` for TAINT), `CallerRef`s and fake call statements;
* `ToyInterpreter`, `ToyProgram` (§9.2): a test `Interpreter` and `MethodContextSource` that build the forward forms of
  `ap-impl.md` §23 (`StatementSummary`, `CallPlan` with `StageKind`s, `RuleStatement`, `ExitRules`) from a small program
  DSL (bindings, field read and write, a source, a sink, a cleaner, a `throw` to an exceptional exit, exit rules at each
  exit, a native callee); `ToyPrograms` holds the programs of `ap.md` §6.3, §6.4, program 3 (a source two levels below a
  return value: `h(){ t = g(); sink(t); }`, `g(){ return f(); }`, `f(){ return src(); }`), the backward cases and a
  method that throws.

| Order | Class | What it checks (item n: `analyzer-core.md` §13) | Mirrors |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `InFlightTest` | Q1–Q3: zero exactly at quiescence; a decrement at handler start ends early | `Quiesce.creach_inv`, `cnt_zero_iff`, `bad_early_done` |
| 2 | `EventQueueTest`, `DeltaWorklistTest` | the order of today; a key does not change in the queue. Item 15: the `unchanged` items come before the `normal` items; a repeat in `unchanged` is dropped; a loop of statements that do not touch a base ends; the set stays across two `Work` events and goes when the step finds `unchanged` empty; `hasZeroWork` sees a zero-to-zero item in either queue; through a `RunMethodAnalyzer` over a `ToyInterpreter`, a fact on a dead local still reaches a later sink (no liveness check) | `analyzer-core.md` §4.3, §6.1 |
| 3 | `EngineAlgebraTest` | DD12, through a `RunMethodAnalyzer` over a `ToyInterpreter` (`EngineAlgebra` is private; `RunnerPort.onProcess` records the items and `onCut` the results): the three modes of `FormApplier` (`ap-impl.md` §23.3) over `EngineAlgebra` and over `ReferenceAlgebra` (`ap-impl.md` §23.8) give the same per-path results (`ops.leaves`) on random statement summaries and inputs; the source-seed filter and the source hit only at a source-seed place, never in GEN; a request only from a FLOW input; the `BIND_IN` stage of a call (`zero.* -> zero.*`) on `Reach.NORMAL` gives `Reach.NORMAL` | `ap-impl.md` §23.3; `Reverse.Stmt.rev` |
| 4 | `SummaryStorageProtocolTest` | mock storages that break P1, P2, P3, P4 lose a summary in the fixed schedule; the real one does not | `PCex.cex_P1` … `cex_P4`, `step_finds_edge` |
| 5 | `IndexCompletenessTest` | `PublicationIndex.candidates` and `CalleeSubscriptions.candidates` return every part that `matches` accepts (random trees) | `PipelineStore.replay_run1`, `deliver_run1`, `replay_restricted`, `deliver_restricted` |
| 6 | `AnyDeliveryTest` (§9.4) | item 3, in a restricted run (§10 row 1) | `PCex.cex_P4`, `deliver_restricted` |
| 7 | `RecordReplayTest` | item 5: direction, reversal, `inside` | `PipelineStore.record_lookup`, rule `retRec` |
| 8 | `NdJoinAdapterTest` | item 4: member 1 by delivery, member 2 by replay, the conclusion in two deltas, through `ndMatch`; the zero fact reaches the same call, and the ND summary never takes the zero subscription (the assert of `ndMatch` holds, and no combination has a zero member); the result premise is the union of the caller premise sets without the zero fact | `PipelineAP.clDN_npart` |
| 9 | `CallPlanRunnerTest` | item 8: the reversed plan of a JVM call runs the steps of `interpreter.md` §4.9 in order (the table of `ap-impl.md` §23.6); seeds at `BOUND`; `PASS_OVER`; the alias guard forward only: the identity part of a delta of `x.$ (T) -> {x.$ (T), x.f.$ (T)}` (TAINT) or of `x.* -> {x.*, x.f.*}` (FLOW) is not aliased, its effect part is (`interpreter.md` AC4 per summary edge); the two `UNRESOLVED` stages; `UnresolvedCallObserver` once per added fact in run 1, never in a later run. Item 17: a demand-layer summary result equal to its start fact goes to the aliases, a normal one does not (`summaryParts`, §4.6); a sink with an end-fact action that triggers on a demand-layer sink edge gives a demand-layer end fact on `{zero}`. THE ZERO BINDING (§4.10): forward, the zero fact (a REACH on `{zero}`) at a call passes over it AND goes through `BIND_IN` to `BOUND` (an unconditional call sink fires), the sources stage and `ADDED` (one `Subscription` and one `LinkIn` per callee, with a REACH added fact; the callee starts the zero fact); backward, a reversed source at a call gives a REACH on `{jb}` at `BOUND` that reaches `BEFORE` through the reversed zero binding, and a REACH on `{jb}` before a call only passes over it | `Reverse.Call.rev` (argued); `Backward.DB` rules `zpass`, `zin` |
| 10 | `ModesTest` | item 8: a request in a restricted run fails; no sink check backward; the zero fact enters every callee backward. DD7: a requirement reaches a source above a seeded sink call; no backward summary `jb → requirement-of-the-seed` exists, and `persist` writes no such record. Item 16: a call whose only callee is a native method is an unresolved call (the pass rules and the default identity act; no analyzer, no link); a call with a native callee and a callee with a body links only to the second one | `RExact.DR_no_request`; the premises of `Backward.DB` rules `zin`, `seed`, `zret` |
| 11 | `FactKindsTest` | DD11 (`ap.md` §7.2): a restricted run never pushes a FLOW item (forward and backward); `raise` rejects a request from a TAINT or a REACH input; run 1: a FLOW added fact and a TAINT summary (a concrete premise mark) give no application and no request, and the standing request of the callee climbs through the link of that caller; a FLOW record applies to a TAINT added fact as a transfer function (TAINT result); an edge with a `PremiseSet` premise is TAINT (`checkKinds`); a conjunction of a `{zero}` input and an `{i}` input gives an `{i}` edge, and of two `{zero}` inputs a `{zero}` edge (`ap.md` §4.6) | `Coverage.summary_step`, `Coverage.req_initial_star`, `climbsB` |
| 12 | `ExitRulesTest` | `analyzer-core.md` §4.3, §4.4; `interpreter.md` §4.7 and §7.2 items 13, 15. Forward: an exit sink on `Result` at the exceptional exit triggers on the thrown tainted value (a witness at that exit); an end fact of it triggers a second exit sink there, and the end order stops (DD4); an exit source at the exceptional exit and a fact that reaches it give no summary edge, and no global-state drop or entry-mark removal acts there, while the same facts at the normal exit give their summaries. Backward: `HandOff` seeds that exit sink; the seed enters at the exceptional exit with the premise `{zero}` and goes through the reversed exit rules of that exit (an exit source of the same exit records its source hit; `interpreter.md` §4.9 SEEDS, `analyzer-core.md` §4.4); a fact that is not zero does not start at the exceptional exit. Item 18, THE GLOBAL-STATE RULE: a conjunctive exit sink `ContainsMark(S.<C>, STATE) ∧ ContainsMark(Result, T)`: at an exit where only the `S` literal holds, the `S` part leaves the summary edge and is the stored input of that literal; a later item with `Result` tainted completes the combination with it (a witness) | `Backward.DB` rule `seed`; `FSeeds.srcHit` |
| 13 | `CutPointTest` | the field limit (`ap.md` §4.4; the table of `ap-impl.md` §5.7): a toy program reaches every value of `Cut` (`RunnerPort.onCut`) with a fact deeper than `L`; after each cut no stored fact has more than `L` counted accessors (the `ap.md` W3 assert at `MethodEdgeStore.add` does not fire); a REACH passes every cut | `limitF_sound` |
| 14 | `RequestJoinTest` | `addLink`/`addRequest` through `StandingJoin` with `ApOps.requestAction` on the `main1`/`main2` example of `ap.md` §4.5 (a new caller edge of an old added fact climbs); request first or link first: each pair meets once | `answerInit_covers`, `climbsB`, Store `standing_complete` |
| 15 | `NaiveClosureTest` | the reference itself on programs 1 and 2: it reports the vulnerabilities of `RCases.p1_found_M`, `p2_found_M`; its demand after run 2 is `dem1_exact`, `dem2_exact` | `Backward.p1_found`, `p2_found`, `dem1_exact`, `dem2_exact` |
| 16 | `ScheduleFuzzTest` (§9.2) | item 1 | `Pipeline.quiescent_exact`, `quiescent_dominates` |
| 17 | `RunManagerLifecycleTest` | item 6: a late send keeps the run open; a new `RunManager` after an aborted one analyses every method; a failed runner does not cancel the next run. Item 12: after `fail(OOM)` a handler that throws `Cancellation.Cancelled` stops its runner, and the run ends `OOM` before its timeout; a `fail()` after the quiescence leaves the run `COMPLETE` (the first end wins); a `fail()` before `run` starts no root; a runner that does not stop gives `FAILED` and no analyzers | `analyzer-core.md` §6.3 |
| 18 | `SupportTest` | the support tree; two premises at two calls are not supported; a set is confirmed as a whole; a merged witness (`ap-impl.md` §7.12). Item 14: one sink statement that two contexts reach is one vulnerability key; a confirmed witness in one context makes it CONFIRMED, and each witness reads the support in its own method key; two alternatives of one sink rule that trigger on two bases with the same premise set give two witnesses, and the store does not fail | `Confirmed.Sup`, `NDConfirmed.SupN`, `NDConfirmed.CexSites.cex_sites`, `Confirmed.Weak.weak_support_gap` |
| 19 | `HandOffTest` | item 7: programs 1 and 2. Program 3 (the case-3 chain, §4.6; the test makes runs 2 and 3 with `HandOff.next` itself, with no stop rule): run 2 gives `{ret.$ (T)} → zero` in `f` and `g` (TAINT × REACH → REACH at each return), the hand-off gives `(zero, ret.$ (T))` per method (case 3), and run 3 keeps the `{zero} → ret.$ (T)` summaries of `f` and `g` and reports the sink of `h` with a confirmed witness. The seeds of a witness are at its method key. `HandOff.next` rejects a decreasing field limit | `Backward.dem1_exact`, `dem2_exact`, `p1_found`, `p2_found` |
| 20 | `SourceSeedsTest` | item 10 (a source at a call, an entry, an exit, a read; end facts never filtered) | `FSeeds.srcHit`, `srcHit_applies`, `PipelineSeeds.driver_iteration_src` |
| 21 | `StopRuleTest`, `ReportTest` | item 9; item 12: the stop rule gives `STOP_RULE`, the policy `POLICY`, an exception at the barrier `ABNORMAL` with the status `FAILED` and the report of the earlier runs. Item 13: run 1 complete (one CONFIRMED and one DEMAND vulnerability), run 2 complete, run 3 incomplete: the report is that of run 1 and run 3 refutes nothing; `continueAfter` is never asked after a backward run | `PipelineDriver.driver_iteration_upto` |
| 22 | JVM regression | item 11: the existing analysis tests through phase 3; the output has every CONFIRMED vulnerability with the SIMPLE trace, and no DEMAND one (§8.1) | — |

### 9.2 The schedule fuzzer

The fuzzer runs the production analyzer, `SubscriptionManager` and `SummaryStorage` on one thread. Each method is its
own unit. One pool holds every event, every `Work`, every deferred replay and every deferred notification. The next
action is a random member of the pool. So every interleaving of the model `Step` (`analyzer-core.md` §5.5) can occur.
The direct calls are events too: `link` always sends `LinkIn`, and `ProtocolSteps` defers the replay and the
notification.

```kotlin
/** analyzer-core.md §13 item 1. Deterministic for a seed. */
class FuzzRun(private val config: RunConfig, private val shared: SharedObjects, seed: Long,
              private val maxQuantum: Int = 4) : ProtocolSteps {
    private val random = Random(seed)
    private val pool = ArrayList<() -> Unit>()
    private val ports = HashMap<MethodKey, Port>()
    private val storages = HashMap<MethodKey, SummaryStorage>()
    private val forms = shared.contexts.directed(config.direction)

    private val processed = LinkedHashSet<Pair<MethodKey, EdgeDelta>>()

    override fun replay(step: () -> Unit) { pool += step }        // the model step `replay`; P1 holds already
    override fun notify(step: () -> Unit) { pool += step }        // the model step `notify`; P2 holds already

    fun run(): FuzzResult {
        config.roots.forEach { post(RunEvent.Start(it)) }
        while (pool.isNotEmpty()) {                               // quiescence: the pool is empty
            val k = random.nextInt(pool.size)
            val action = pool[k]
            pool[k] = pool[pool.lastIndex]; pool.removeAt(pool.lastIndex)
            action()
        }
        val analyzers = ports.values.map { it.analyzer.also(RunMethodAnalyzer::freeze) }
        return FuzzResult.of(processed, analyzers, shared, config)   // runs Support (§7.5) on a RunResult of the analyzers
    }

    private fun port(key: MethodKey) = ports.getOrPut(key) { Port(key) }
    private fun post(e: RunEvent) { val p = port(e.target()); pool += { p.handle(e) } }

    private inner class Port(val key: MethodKey) : RunnerPort {

        override fun post(event: RunEvent.Delivery) { pool += { handle(event) } }
        override fun enqueue(analyzer: RunMethodAnalyzer) { pool += { work(analyzer) } }
        private fun work(a: RunMethodAnalyzer) { if (!a.work(1 + random.nextInt(maxQuantum))) pool += { work(a) } }   // W2
        override fun analyzer(key: MethodKey) = port(key).analyzer.also { check(key == this.key) }
        override fun applier(caller: MethodKey): SummaryApplier = analyzer(caller)
        override fun subscribe(sub: Subscription) = subscriptions.subscribe(sub)
        override fun summaryStorage(key: MethodKey) =

        override fun link(callee: MethodKey, ref: CallerRef, linkLayer: Layer, added: Facts) =
            post(RunEvent.LinkIn(callee, ref, linkLayer, added))  // the direct call 2 as an event
    }
}
```

The reference is `NaiveClosure` (DD10). It is the closure that the engine computes in one run: Lean `D` with `DS`
and `DN` (run 1), `DR` (a restricted forward run), `Backward.DB` (a backward run). It works per path, on the reference
forms (`ap-impl.md` §6). It applies the forms with `FormApplier` over `ReferenceAlgebra` (`ap-impl.md` §23.3, §23.8), so the oracle
and the engine share the mode logic and differ only in the fact algebra (DD12). It has no tree, no edge store, no
subscription index, no thread and no subsumption. It reads the demand and the records of its `RunConfig` through their
lookups (`DemandStore.near`, `RecordStore.byEntry`, `byExit`; their completeness is a test of `ap-impl.md` §8) and
tests each candidate itself.

At a call it runs the one per-path plan walk `FormsReference.run` (`ap-impl.md` §23.8) with the guards of the engine
(`PlanHooks`): the closure writes no plan walk and no `Origin` rule of its own. It is test-only
(`TEST/bidi/engine/NaiveClosure.kt`). Each rule body follows the rule of the engine that its comment names. Every form
applies at the `Place` of the engine: a statement and the rule statements of a boundary at
`Place(node, run1, sources = true)` (so in run 1 the static exception of `ap.md` §4.10 item 1 acts at the entry and exit
rule statements, as in `RuleWorklist.input`, §4.4), a stage by its kind (`FormsReference.run`).

```kotlin
class ScheduleFuzzTest {
    @Test
    fun `every schedule reaches the same closure`() {
        for (program in ToyPrograms.all) {                    // programs 1 (ap.md §6.3), 2 (ap.md §6.4), 3 (§9.1), the backward cases

`FuzzResult.processed` holds, per `PathKey`, the leaves (`FormsReference.conclusions`) of every processed item, from
both queues of `DeltaWorklist`. The two results compare per `PathKey` with `dominates` in both directions.
`program.shared()` makes new stores per seed (a new `ConcurrentVulnerabilityStore`, `PersistentRecordStore`).

### 9.3 Proof-first map

Each test names the Lean theorem or counterexample in the table of §9.1. The protocol tests follow the traces of the
namespace `PCex` in `PipelineProofs.lean`: one test per counterexample, with a mock that breaks the condition, and the
same schedule on the real code.

### 9.4 A protocol test: the `[any]` delivery (P4)

The test runs in a RESTRICTED forward run: there a fact with `[any]` above the premise satisfies it (`inside`). In run 1,
`applicable` rejects a fact above the premise, so the case does not exist there.

```kotlin
class AnyDeliveryTest {
    private val ap = ApManager(Cancellation())
    private val ops = ApOps(ap)
    private val f = ApFixtures(ap, ops)                       // test builders: patterns → InitialAp, Facts, CallerRef

    /** A SubscriptionPort that records the applications and keeps the deliveries in an inbox. */
    private class RecordingPort(override val config: RunConfig, override val ops: ApOps) : SubscriptionPort {
        override val steps = ProtocolSteps.Inline
        val storages = HashMap<MethodKey, SummaryStorage>()
        val inbox = ArrayDeque<RunEvent.Delivery>()
        val applied = ArrayList<Triple<Subscription, Publication, Int>>()
        override fun summaryStorage(key: MethodKey) = storages.getOrPut(key) { SummaryStorage(key, ops.manager, ops, steps) }
        override fun applier(caller: MethodKey) = object : SummaryApplier {
            override fun applySummary(part: Subscription, pub: Publication, member: Int) { applied += Triple(part, pub, member) }
            override fun applyRecord(part: Subscription, record: Record) = Unit
        }
        override fun post(event: RunEvent.Delivery) { inbox += event }
    }

    @Test
    fun `a caller fact with any above the premise gets a summary published after its subscription`() {
        val config = RunConfig(3, fieldLimit = 3, demand = DemandStore.Builder(ap).build(),
            records = PersistentRecordStore(ap).view(), seeds = SeedIndex.EMPTY, roots = emptyList())
        val port = RecordingPort(config, ops)
        val manager = SubscriptionManager(port)
        val callee = f.method("callee"); val caller = f.method("caller")
        repeat(12) { k ->                                     // >= 10 entries: today the literal index is active (MethodTreeAccessPathSubscription.kt:211-213)
            manager.subscribe(Subscription(callee, f.ref(caller, call = k), Layer.NORMAL,
                f.tree("arg0", listOf("f$k"), Tail.EXACT, mark = "T")))
        }
        val any = Subscription(callee, f.ref(caller, call = 99), Layer.DEMAND, f.tree("arg0", emptyList(), Tail.ANY, mark = "T"))
        manager.subscribe(any)                                // the replay reads an empty storage
        assertTrue(port.applied.isEmpty())

        val j = f.initial("arg0", listOf("g", "h"), Tail.EXACT, mark = "T")    // (arg0, .g.h, $, T) lies inside (arg0, ., [any], T)
        val pub = Publication(j, f.tree("ret", emptyList(), Tail.EXACT, mark = "T"))   // one member: the key is j itself
        port.summaryStorage(callee).publish(listOf(pub))     // P2: insert, then notify → one Delivery
        while (port.inbox.isNotEmpty()) port.inbox.removeFirst().let { manager.onDelivery(it.callee, it.publications) }   // P6

        val hit = port.applied.single { it.first.ref.call == f.call(99) }
        assertEquals(pub, hit.second)
        assertEquals(ops.satisfying(any.added, j, config.mode), hit.first.added)   // P4: the replay function
        assertTrue(port.applied.none { it.first.ref.call != f.call(99) })           // (arg0, .f_k, $) does not contain j
    }
}
```

It mirrors `Pipeline.PCex.cex_P4`: the same trace (`proc sub`, `replay sub` on an empty storage, `proc pub`,
`notify pub`, `deliver`), with the one match function, so the analyzer processes the join (`PCex.step_finds_edge`). A
second test publishes first and subscribes after; it asserts the same `hit.first.added` through the replay. Both
`assertEquals` on trees read the structural `Facts.equals` (DD4).

## 10. Spec issues

This document implements `analyzer-core.md` as it is. These points of the spec need a decision; the right column says
what this document does:

| # | `analyzer-core.md` | Problem | What this document does |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | §13 item 3 | The `[any]` delivery case exists only in a restricted run (`inside`). In run 1, `applicable` rejects a fact above the premise. | `AnyDeliveryTest` runs in run 3 (§9.4). |
| 2 | §4.8, §4.9 | The cache keeps the forms per method, or per (method, direction). But the call plans and the entry rules read the context of the method key (the callees, the start filter). | The forms are per method key (DD6; `ap-impl.md` §31.2). |
| 3 | §0, §6.3, §7.1 | `analyzer-core.md` §0 puts the budget in the iteration policy, and `analyzer-core.md` §6.3 ends a run by a timeout. But `IterationPolicy` and `RunManager.run()` take no budget. | `IterationPolicy.timeout`, `IterationDriver(policy, shared, budget)`, `RunManager.run(timeout)` (§3.2, §7.1). |
| 4 | §8 | The spec keeps the progress log. Today's progress job reads runner-local statistics from another thread. | The progress log reads only the atomic counters of `InFlight` and the memory usage (§3.2); today's per-method statistics are not kept (§2.1). |
