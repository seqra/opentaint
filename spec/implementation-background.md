# Implementation background

This file describes existing code and migration context. It is not normative.
The current specs define the required behavior. Code here is historical unless
the current implementation proposals explicitly adopt it.

## Analyzer code reuse

## 8. Code reuse

| Today | Decision | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `TaintAnalysisUnitRunnerManager`, `AnalysisUnitRunnerManager` | REFACTOR into `RunManager` | keep the unit routing, the runner spawn, the counter, the timeout, the memory guard and the progress log; remove `resetApManager`, the delayed units and the cross-run fields; add `RunConfig`, the per-run scope, the join of the runners and the map of the `SummaryStorage`s |
| `TaintAnalysisUnitRunner` | REFACTOR into `UnitRunner` | keep the channel, the priority queue, the quantum and `MethodAnalyzerStorage`; the events of §5.1 |
| `AnalysisRunner` | REPLACE by `RunnerPort` (§6.1) | |
| `MethodAnalyzerStorage` | REUSE with a factory | the `EmptyMethodContext` twin goes; the context cache shares the per-method parts (§4.8) |
| `MethodAnalyzer`, `NormalMethodAnalyzer` | REPLACE by `RunMethodAnalyzer` | §4; `TimedMethodAnalyzer` becomes a decorator of the new interface |
| `EmptyMethodAnalyzer` | REMOVE | an empty method is never analysed and never a callee (§4.4) |
| `MethodAnalyzerEdges`, `EdgeCollection` | REUSE the structure | the new keys of `ap.md` §8.1; the list of `EdgeCollection` becomes the `normal` queue of `DeltaWorklist` (§4.3) |
| `AccessPathBaseStorage`, `MethodAnalyzerEdges.EdgeStorage` | NOT USED, REPLACE | `AccessPathBaseStorage` rejects the zero base; the conclusion group of `ap-impl.md` §4.3 (one premise key, every base and kind) replaces `EdgeStorage` (`ap.md` §7.6) |
| `JIRLocalVariableReachability` (`isReachable`) | NOT USED by the core | no liveness check (§4.3); the alias analysis keeps it as its own input (§4.8) |
| `Edge` (`ZeroToZero`, `ZeroToFact`, `FactToFact`, `NDFactToFact`) | REPLACE | `ap.md` §7.6 |
| `SummaryEdgeStorageWithSubscribers`, `MethodSummariesUnitStorage` | REUSE the pattern | publications per premise key and layer; the lock of P3 (§5.2); one storage per method key in the `RunManager` |
| `SummaryEdgeSubscriptionManager`, `CommonAPSub`, the tree sub-storages | REUSE the pattern | the registration on the first `getOrPut`, the delta insert, the replay, the match at delivery; P4 with one `matches`; one manager per runner |
| side-effect requirements and summaries, `TaintMarkFieldUnfoldRequest`, `MethodSideEffectSummaryHandler`, `triggerSideEffectRequirement` | REMOVE | the requests over the links (§4.6) |
| fact-depth delay (`INITIAL_ALLOWED_FACT_DEPTH`, `MethodAnalysisDelayed`, `DelayedAnalysisResume`, `factLimit`) | REMOVE | the field limit (`ap.md` §4.4) |
| `InitialFactAbstraction` (tree, automata, cactus) | REMOVE | the policy and the emission (§4.4) |
| `MethodSummaryEdgeApplicationUtils`, `MethodCallSummaryHandler` | REPLACE | `applySummary` (`ap.md` §4.3); the rewriter moves to the interpreter |
| `TaintSinkTracker`, the vulnerability buckets of `TaintAnalysisUnitStorage` | REPLACE | the `VulnerabilityStore` (§4.7) and the conjunction store (`ap.md` §8.9); no lossy merge |
| `MethodCallResolver`, `JIRMethodCallResolver` | ADAPT | today it is typed to `TaintAnalysisUnitRunner` and calls back with a `MethodCallHandler` per edge kind; the new one gives the resolved callees to `callPlan`, with no empty method (§4.4) |
| `TrackerWithSubscriber`, `LambdaTracker` | REUSE as the source of the prescan values | no lambda event in the new core (§5.1) |
| `MethodEntrypointResolver`, `UnitResolver`, `LanguageManager` | REUSE | |
| `ApplicationGraph.reversed`, `MethodInstGraph` | REUSE | `JIRAnalysisManager` downcasts the graph to `JApplicationGraph`; ADAPT it to accept the reversed graph |
| `JIRBackwardExitWiringGraph` (`saloed/backward-main`) | PORT | with a cache per method (§4.4) |
| `StatementSummaryBuilder`, `buildReversed`, the JVM flow functions | ADAPT | the forward interpreter of §4.9 (`interpreter.md`); `buildReversed` becomes `StatementSummary.reversed` in the core |
| `JIRMethodAnalysisContext` | SPLIT | the cached part and the run part (§4.8) |
| `MemoryManager`, `Cancellation`, `UnitRunnerStats`, `MethodStats` | REUSE | one instance per run where it has run state; the `RunManager` activates the `Cancellation` in its constructor (§6.3); one more `MemoryManager` for each barrier, with the threshold of today's confirmation (§7.2 B4) |
| summary serialization (`storeSummaries`, `loadSummariesFromRunner`) | NOT USED | the records are the reuse between runs |
| `trace/*` | OUT OF SCOPE | no store of a run stays for it (§7.6); phase 3 gives every report entry, CONFIRMED and DEMAND, the simple trace `TracePathGenerationResult.Simple` (§9) |

Do not copy the defects of today that Appendix A lists. Each one has its rule in this document: P3 and P4 (§5.3),
no edge post-processor (§4.3), the new engine per run (§2, §7.6), the per-run scope (§6.3), the fixed priority keys
(§6.1), and the correct interners of the `ApManager` (O4).

## Analyzer reference code at the cleaner checkpoint

## 10. Reference code

The types of the messages and the stores. `PathFact`, `Pattern`, `InitialAp`, `PremiseKey` (`size`, `member(k)`,
`isZero`), `PathNode`, `Facts` (`Reach`, `FlowTree`, `TaintTree`), `PathEdge`, `Direction`, `Record`, `RecordStore`
and the tests are those of `ap.md` §3.4, §4, §7 and §8.7. The premise key is the premise set of `ap.md` §4.6 and §8.1.

Other names: `SharedObjects` holds the shared objects of §2. `confirm` computes steps 1 and 2 of §7.5 on the links of
a complete forward run and sets `SinkWitness.confirmed`. `handOffOf(config, result, report)` gives the `HandOff` of a
complete run by §7.3 and §7.4: `demandOf` builds the `DemandStore` of the next run from `summaries.demandEdges()` of
every analyzer (the stored publications of the leaves that are not crossable, §4.6; a backward run also gives its
zero-premise edges), with every pattern mark `*∖X` replaced by `*` (the hand-off normalization, F72 R1, §7.3), and
`seedsOf` the `SeedIndex` (a forward run: the witnesses of `report.demandEntries()`; a
backward run: the `sourceHits`). `ApOps.demandPart` (`ap-impl.md` §5.9) gives the non-crossable part of a summary
value at each summary delta (§4.6); its per-leaf forms are `cross` and `crossReversed` (`ap-impl.md` §6; Lean
`Handoff.Cross`, `Handoff.CrossB`). `nextConfig` makes the `RunConfig` of the next run. `frontierOf(config, result, handOff, report)` makes the frontier of §7.8 in one pass over the `counters` of the
analyzers (§4.1), the hand-off and the report.
`RecordStore.view` gives the read-only view of a run; `RecordStore.persist` adds the records of `ap.md` §8.7 R1 at a
barrier. `CalleeSubscriptions` and `PublicationIndex` are the path tries of §5.3 and §5.2.
`MethodContextCache.forms(key: MethodKey)` gives the cached forms of §4.8 for a method key, in both directions: the
per-method forms that every context shares and the per-key forms of that context. `RunManager.fail(status)` is the
abnormal end of §6.3: if the compare-and-set of the run status from "no end" to `status` succeeds, it cancels the
`Cancellation` and completes the run; else (after the quiescence or an earlier end) it does nothing. The timeout of the
run (`TIMEOUT`), the memory guard of the run (`OOM`), a runner exception and a throw in the code of the run on the
caller thread (`FAILED`) call it. `RunManager.run(timeout)` joins the runners on every exit (§6.3).

## Appendix A. Today's analyzer

The analysis of the current core (`core/opentaint-dataflow-core`, the code of `origin/main`). The design of this
document starts from it.

ENTITIES.

* `TaintAnalysisUnitRunnerManager` (one per analysis): spawns one `TaintAnalysisUnitRunner` per unit (a package; an
  unknown unit is not analyzed). It routes the work between the units and counts the events. It ends a run at
  quiescence, at a timeout or at the memory guard. The prescan and the full scan reuse it after `resetApManager`.
* `TaintAnalysisUnitRunner` (one coroutine per unit): a channel and a priority queue. The events:
  `MethodWithContext`, `ExternalInputFact` (zero, fact, side-effect requirement), `MethodAnalyzer`,
  `NewSummaryEdgeEvent`, `NewSideEffectRequirementEvent`, `NewSideEffectSummaryEvent`, `LambdaResolvedEvent`,
  `MethodAnalysisDelayed`, `DelayedAnalysisResume`.
* `NormalMethodAnalyzer` (one per `MethodEntryPoint`): the tabulation over four edge kinds (zero-to-zero,
  zero-to-fact, fact-to-fact, ND); a LIFO worklist; `MethodAnalyzerEdges` with merge and subsumption; the initial-fact
  abstraction; the fact-depth delay. The summaries, the side-effect requirements and the side-effect summaries wait
  until the worklist is empty. `EmptyMethodAnalyzer` publishes the identity summaries of the most abstract facts.
* `SummaryEdgeStorageWithSubscribers` (callee side, one per entry point, in the unit storage): one writer (the runner
  of the callee) under a monitor, and the subscribers in a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`. The new part of an insert goes to
  every subscriber as an event.
* `SummaryEdgeSubscriptionManager` (caller side, two per runner: internal and external): registers its handler on the
  first subscription to a callee, inserts the caller fact (delta), replays the callee storage synchronously, and
  matches every delivered summary against its subscriptions when the event runs.

PIPELINES.

* A caller fact goes to the callee as an initial fact: synchronously in the same unit, as an `ExternalInputFact`
  event across units. The subscription and its replay come first.
* A summary goes from the exit of the callee to its storage, then as an event to every subscribed runner, then to the
  caller analyzers whose subscriptions match.
* The refinements travel up as side-effect requirements (the exclusion of an initial fact) and side-effect summaries
  (the mark-unfold request after `[any]`). A zero-to-fact caller with a concrete fact answers the unfold request
  directly to the method that asked.
* The counter: increment before the send, decrement after the event. Zero ends the run, or starts a deepening round
  when analyzers are delayed.

DEFECTS FOUND (none of them is in the design above).

* P3: the replay read of a callee storage takes no lock. It reads fastutil maps and plain fields while the writer
  changes them (`SummaryEdgeStorageWithSubscribers.factEdges` and the other finders; the
  `ConcurrentReadSafeInt2ObjectMap` reads). This works on x86 and HotSpot, but the Java memory model does not guarantee
  it: a replay can miss an old summary, and no notification gives it again.
* P4: the delivery index (`AccessTreeIndex.findStartsWith`, `MethodTreeAccessPathSubscription.kt`) follows literal
  accessors and misses a caller fact with `[any]` above the summary premise; the replay treats `[any]` as a wildcard.
  When a sub-storage has 10 or more entries, a summary published after the subscription is lost for that fact. The
  summaries with several premises (by base on the replay, by prefix on the delivery) and the requirements (exact
  children on the replay) also use different filters on the two paths.
* The tree summary storage does not notify when only the exclusion of a summary grows; today the requirement channel
  covers it. The new core has no such channel, so every growth must be a delta.
* `handleUnchangedStatementEdge`: the unchanged edge normally goes through `addSequentialUnchangedEdge`, which is
  correct. When the edge post-processor returns a NEW edge object, the code propagates the input edge (as a changed
  edge) and drops the processed one. `JIRMethodSummaryEdgeProcessor` returns a new object for every fact-to-fact edge
  at an exit. So a PARTIAL exit compatibility filter is lost for a fact that is unchanged at the exit; a full
  rejection (an empty list) works. Precision only. The new core has no post-processor (`interpreter.md` D14).
* Across runs: `analyzerEnqueued`, the runner `factLimit`, the sticky `status` and the counters survive. A failed
  runner cancels the shared scope. A runner that does not stop can run into the next run.
* `EventComparator` reads mutable keys. `ConcurrentReadSafeObject2IntMap` can hang the interner (non-volatile reads in
  a retry loop).

## Interpreter migration differences

## 6. Deviations from today's code

The columns "Today" use today's notation (§0).

| # | Topic | Today | New | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | read `x = y.f` | `y\{f} → y`, `y.f → y.f`, `y.f → x` (keep-except) | `y.* → y.*`, `y.f.* → x.*` | a read never changes an exclusion (I3) |
| D2 | self read `x = x.f` | `x\{f} → null` (refine only), `x.f → x` | `x.f.* → x.*` | no refinement |
| D3 | a fact above a micro-edge premise | the premise is refined (`SideEffectRequirement`, `refineInitial`) | unguarded `concat`: an `[any]` result in the demand layer (an `[any-taint]` fact keeps its layer, I2) | no refinement (I2) |
| D4 | mark readers at sinks, sources, cleaners, exits | `FactReader` refinement, any-field unfold requests | the request, run 1 only (§5.4) | ap.md §4.5 |
| D5 | summary application | delta with refinement (`tryApplySummaryEdge`) | guarded by satisfaction | ap.md §4.3 |
| D6 | call bindings | rebase functions (`mapMethodCallToStartFlowFact`, `mapMethodExitToReturnFlowFact`) | binding micro edges (§3.1) | one operation for every flow (I4); same mapping |
| D7 | Go cleaners | only the summary rewriter, only user-defined `RemoveMark` | `clean` at the call site for every cleaner rule, plus the rewriter | the same cleaner placement in both languages |
| D8 | selected-mark cleaner on an abstract fact | `DeepAccessorExclusion` claims; a refinement request on abstract nodes | same-base `clean`: `*∖(X ∪ {T})` and a run-1 request T, for every path and reach (F75) | ap.md §4.7 |
| D9 | reach `ExactAndAnyField` | cleans only through an `[any]` at the position | `atAndBelow` | `[any]` means "any continuation" in the new AP. The cleaner removes a mark only from a fact that lies inside the cleaned locations (ap.md §4.7), so it over-approximates |
| D10 | `RemoveAllMarks(P.AnyField)` | removes only an `[any]` child | `(P, below, all)` | the same meaning of `[any]` |
| D11 | type filter form | `FactTypeChecker` over the tree (Accept, Reject, FilterNext) | `filter(base, may)`, prefix-closed, tails kept, a separate mark policy | the ap.md §4.8 primitive; same predicate |
| D12 | `[any]` or `[any-taint]` fact with a primitive-tracking mark on a primitive base | kept as `$` | kept with its tail (`[any]` or `[any-taint]`) | the filter never changes a tail (precision only: the locations below a primitive value are not valid, I13) |
| D13 | filter of the caller content under `*` in the summary application | `AccessTree.concat` filters by the path type | none | the filter acts on bases at fixed points; precision only (Q3) |
| D14 | exit compatibility filter (`JIRMethodSummaryEdgeProcessor`) | removes `*` at incompatible fields | none | the same (Q3) |
| D16 | depth gate, `[any]` depth charge in the step | `INITIAL_ALLOWED_FACT_DEPTH`, `+10,000` | the field limit only | ap.md §4.4 |
| D17 | rules on a static position (JVM) | applied as written | the mapping of §1.4: an `[any]` or `[any-taint]` target on a class position, a pass rule from or to a class position, a `ContainsMarkOnAnyField` literal in a rule with a class target, and `RemoveAllMarks(P.AnyField)` on `S` are rule errors; `RemoveAllMarks` on a class, a static field or deeper is the kill of a strong write; `RemoveAllMarks(AnyClassStatic)` is the whole-base cleaner (D27); `AnyClassStatic` in another rule element is a rule error | a static access always names a field, a pass rule is a handcrafted summary, and the construction rules of I12 must hold |
| D18 | pass rule with an `AnyField` position | the content below the any-field node of `P` is copied below `Q` | an `AnyField` target (`CopyAllMarks(P → Q.AnyField)`, `CopyMark(T, P → Q.AnyField)`): the `[any]` target (§4.1), a MAY: an uncorrelated result in the demand layer (W6); in the backward run every result of its reversal is in the demand layer, also a `$` result (§4.9). It is not the `[any-taint]` target of a source (I14, D32). An `AnyField` position on the premise side: a rule error (D33) | the field that the rule writes is not known, so a correlated edge does not cover the flow; precision only |
| D19 | a `Lambda` result of the call resolver (§3.9) | a resolution failure (the unresolved path) beside the lambda methods (`JIRMethodCallResolver.kt:184-209`) | the lambda methods of the prescan only; a resolution failure only if the prescan knows no lambda | the prescan resolves every lambda before run 1 (analyzer-core.md §9); fewer findings are possible (user decision, 2026-10-07) |
| D20 | a cleaner with a mark literal in its condition (§4.2) | the condition is evaluated on the fact (`TaintFactAwareConditionEvaluator`): a negated literal counts as true, and a literal can hold on the cleaned fact | the cleaner does not act | only an unconditional cleaner is sound for a fact-local engine; more findings are possible (user decision, 2026-10-07) |
| D21 | exit sinks (§4.7) | the production rule provider applies them only on zero-premise edges (`JIRMethodExitRuleProvider.kt:18-19`) | every fact at the exit | the sink check of ap.md §4.9 on every fact; more findings are possible (user decision, 2026-10-07) |
| D22 | an unconditional exit sink | no effect (`applyUnconditionalSinks` is a stub, `JIRMethodSequentFlowFunction.kt:191-200`) | it fires on the zero fact at both exits (ap.md §4.9; D26) | the same rule as every unconditional sink; more findings are possible (user decision, 2026-10-07) |
| D23 | the summary rewriter (§3.7, §5.2) | the rule selection: every user-defined source rule and every user-defined cleaner rule whose condition is not statically false (`JIRMethodCallRuleBasedSummaryRewriter.kt:67-85`); not applied on a zero-premise summary result and on the default identity of an unresolved callee (`JIRMethodCallSummaryHandler.kt:29-38, 71-90`) | the rule selection: every user-defined source rule whose condition is not statically false, and every user-defined cleaner rule whose condition is statically true; applied on every summary result and unresolved result | rule-guided flow: the rule overrides the callee for its marks; one rule for every result of the call; a conditional cleaner does not act (as D20). Fewer findings are possible (the results), more are possible (the cleaner selection) (user decisions, 2026-10-07 and `ap-history.md` F67) |
| D24 | a pass rule (`CopyAllMarks`, `CopyMark`) with a mark literal in its condition (§4.2) | the condition is evaluated on the fact | a rule error, logged once and not rejected (§1.3); the rule applies without its mark literals; a pass rule makes no ND edge | a pass rule has no mark-dependent condition (user decision, 2026-10-08); no exact form (gap G11) |
| D25 | liveness (§2.1 step 1) | the method analyzer drops an edge whose fact is on a local that is dead at the statement, also at a call (`MethodAnalyzer.kt:296`; JVM `JIRLocalVariableReachability`; Go: no drop) | no liveness step: the statement step keeps a fact on a dead local; the alias analysis keeps its own inputs | today's liveness goes backward from the exits of the forward graph, so in code that reaches no exit (a worker loop that never returns) every local is dead and its facts go. A dead local is not read again, so elsewhere the effect is more facts only; more findings are possible (`ap-history.md` F67) |
| D26 | the unconditional exit rules at the exceptional exit (§4.7) | the unconditional exit sources fire only at the normal exit (`JIRMethodSequentFlowFunction.kt:228-233`) | the unconditional exit sources and the unconditional exit sinks fire on the zero fact at both exits; an unconditional exit sink can report at both exits (accepted) | the exit rules act at both exits: the two exits are the one virtual exit of the model (ap.md S4); expected, more findings are possible (user decision, `ap-history.md` F67) |
| D27 | the Spring dispatcher cleanup (`__cleanup__`, §1.4, §5.2) | a fact-dependent cleaner: the rule provider builds it from the fact, for a fact on `S` the action `RemoveAllMarks(ClassStatic(C))` for each class of the fact except the registry class `__spring_registry__` (`SpringRuleProvider.kt:104-143`) | the generated dispatcher saves and restores the registry around each `__cleanup__()` call: for each static field `f` of `__spring_registry__` (one field per component, `SpringWebProject.kt:160-200`), `%reg_f = __spring_registry__.f` before the call and `__spring_registry__.f = %reg_f` after it (`ndMethodDispatch`, `SpringWebProject.kt:311`). The rule of `__cleanup__` is the fact-free unconditional whole-base cleaner `RemoveAllMarks(AnyClassStatic)`, that is `(S, atAndBelow, all)`: the rule provider gives it for a query with no fact; a query with a fact (the current core of the prescan) keeps today's cleaner | no rule of the new analysis needs the fact; the effect is the same: the static content outside the registry goes, and the registry stays (`ap-history.md` F67) |
| D28 | an empty method (I8) | JVM: an empty method has no instruction, so no entry statement and no method key; the call enters nothing for it, and its bound facts are lost (`JMethodBoundaryInstFeature.kt:13`). Go: a resolved callee; `EmptyMethodAnalyzer` publishes the identity summary of the most abstract premise `(b, [], *, {}, *)` (`MethodAnalyzerStorage.kt:19-31`) | never a callee: the resolver drops it; a call whose every resolution result is an empty method is unresolved (§3.7: the default identity and the pass rules) | an empty method is not analysable; the unresolved path is the summary of a callee with no body; more findings are possible (an all-empty call takes the unresolved path, and the pass rules apply); a mixed call: G12 (`ap-history.md` F67) |
| D29 | a rule position with an inner or a repeated `AnyField` (§1.3) | handled by the fact readers (`FactReaderUtils.kt:54-138`) | a rule error: the interpreter rejects the whole rule (no form at any place, and the rewriter does not select it, §1.3, §5.2) and logs it once | `[any]` is a tail only (ap.md W4); fewer findings are possible (`ap-history.md` F67) |
| D30 | the global-state rule (§4.7 step 3, G2) | the exit sinks run only on zero-premise edges (`JIRMethodExitRuleProvider.kt:18-19`); the evaluated `S` facts of a REACHED exit sink are dropped (`JIRSequentTaintUtil.kt:76-85`, `JIRMethodSequentFlowFunction.kt:186-188`) | for an item whose premise is the zero fact, the evaluated `S` part goes also when a conjunctive exit sink is not complete, and stays the stored input of its literal; a caller-set `S` fact is evaluated (D21) but not dropped: it returns to the caller through the callee summary | `ap-history.md` F67 (5), F68 (3); fewer facts in the callers of the method that sets the state; the FP shapes of a caller-set state: G2 |
| D31 | an exit source with two or more positive literals in one alternative of its condition (§4.7 step 1, §5.3) | evaluated fact-locally from stored assumptions with an empty precondition (`JIRMethodSequentFlowFunction.kt:211-219`, `TaintUtil.kt:97-104, 203-207`): it fires under the premise of the fact that completes the combination | an ND edge at the exit, as at a call: each literal stores its input; a full combination is an exit item with the union of the premise sets, and at the normal exit an ND summary (E6); not a rule error | the correct premise set (today the result belongs to one fact); the findings of today stay (`ap-history.md` F68 (4)) |
| D32 | a source with an `AnyField` target (§4.1, I14): `AssignMarkOnAnyAccessor` (Go `AnyAccessor`), or `AssignMark` on `PositionWithAccess(P, AnyField)` (for example the DTO argument of a Spring entry point, `SpringRuleProvider.kt:61-76`); at a call, at the method start, at an exit or at a read, plain or conjunctive | the source makes a fact with an `[any]` accessor below `P` (`Source.kt:26`). In the new AP before F69 this fact had the `[any]` tail, so W6 put every result of it in the demand layer: a vulnerability whose taint came only from it was never confirmed (a DEMAND entry) | the target tail `[any-taint]`, a MUST, in the forward runs only (ap.md W8). Its results keep their layer, so a normal edge with it is complete, and such a vulnerability can be CONFIRMED: in run 1 when the sink reads the tainted object in the method of the source (`AnyTaintExCases2.PassRule.source_confirmed`), or after a callee whose FLOW summary keeps the whole object (program I, ap.md §6.2; `AnyTaintExCases2.I.run1_confirmed`); in a restricted run through a getter (program G, `AnyTaintExCases2.G.run3_confirmed`) and with the sink in the callee (program C, `AnyTaintExCases2.C.run3_confirmed`). These results are of the closures `AnyTaintEx.D6X` (run 1, a spec closure) and `AnyTaintEx.DRXs` (run 3 with the earlier restriction and the earlier hand-off: the record of the earlier design, ap.md §10.11); with the intersection and the hand-off of the demand edges (the spec closures `AnyTaintEx.DRX` with `HandoffX.restrictIX`) the run-3 results of programs G and C are argued (ap.md §11.2). The round-1 results of the same programs, in `AnyTaintCases`, are of `AnyTaint.D6T` and `DRT`. A strong write into the object keeps it exact with an EXCLUSION: after the setter `dto.setName(c)` the object is `(dto, ., [any-taint], {name}, T)`, normal, so `sink(dto.name)` is not reported and `sink(dto.email)` is CONFIRMED in run 1 (§2.4; program S, `AnyTaintExCases.S.run1_dto_ann`, `S.run1_name_not_reported`, `S.run1_email_confirmed`). A read through an excluded accessor gives nothing (program R), and the cleaners `atAndBelow` and `below` one accessor below the object add the accessor to the exclusion (§5.2; program CL). Only these operations make it `[any]` in the demand layer, with no exclusion (ap.md §2.2): the field-limit cut (`AnyTaintExCases.CUT.cut_reports`); a primitive AP cleaner `part` row other than the `atAndBelow` and `below` rows one accessor below the object, that is the primitive `exact` cleaner at the path of the object or below it, and a primitive cleaner two or more accessors below it (an excluded path cleans nothing; §5.2; `CL.exact_result`); F74 named field actions apply that primitive to the temporary and keep normal outside-field facts (`FieldCleanerX`); a may target (the `[any]` target of a pass rule, D18); a demand input (a demand fact, summary or record); and the must-record demotion (ap.md §4.3; `AnyTaintEx.recLayerX`). A weak update keeps the object whole (§0.1). A pass rule with an `AnyField` target keeps `[any]` (D18). The backward run has no `[any-taint]` (§4.9) | the `[any]` target of a source is a must, so W6 lost precision on it; the demotion at an exclusion (the first F69 text) lost it again at every setter (`AnyTaintExCases.S.run1T_not_confirmed`). The normal edges of run 1 are exact; in a restricted run a normal edge of a must-premise is END-EXACT; a confirmed vulnerability is real (ap.md §10.11). Every complete forward run reports every real vulnerability that no earlier forward run confirmed, in some layer (`HandoffXIter.iteration_generalNX`, with the seeds of the DEMAND entries of the report, §4.9; with the seeds of every reported vulnerability and the hand-off before F70: `AnyTaintExCov.iteration_reportsX`). The exclusion removes the reports of the excluded locations, and these are not real (`AnyTaintExCases.S.name_not_real`, `X.locations_exact`). More confirmed entries, fewer demand entries (`ap-history.md` F69) |
| D33 | a pass rule with an `AnyField` position on its premise side (§1.3, §4.1): `CopyAllMarks(P.AnyField → Q)`, `CopyMark(T, P.AnyField → Q)`, also with an `AnyField` target; Go `CopyData`, `CopyTaintMark` with `AnyAccessor` on the from position | the content below the any-field node of `P` is copied below `Q` (D18) | a rule error: the interpreter rejects the whole rule and logs it once (§1.3, as D29) | the rule reads one field that it does not know, so its result is a may; but a `$` result of an `[any]` premise keeps its layer (ap.md §4.1), so W6 cannot keep the may out of the normal layer, and a finding that rests on it could be CONFIRMED. Today's rule base has no such rule: the only `AnyField` in a pass rule is a target (Go `json.Unmarshal`, `arg(0) → arg(1).*`) (`ap-history.md` F69) |
| D34 | the summary rewriter on an `AnyField` action position of a selected source (§5.2): `AssignMarkOnAnyAccessor` on `P`, `AssignMark` on `PositionWithAccess(P, AnyField)` (Go `AnyAccessor`) | the rewriter cleans every action position with `RemoveMark(T, position, Exact)` (`JIRMethodCallRuleBasedSummaryRewriter.kt:105`); on `PositionWithAccess(P, AnyField)` that is the `below` row of §5.2. The text of §5.2 before F69 gave `clean(P, exact, T)` | `clean(P, atAndBelow, T)` | the source marks every location at or below `P` (a must, I14), so these are the rule positions that the rewriter overrides. The `exact` cleaner at `P` keeps the marks of the callee below `P`, and on an `[any-taint]` result at `P` it gives a `part` result in the demand layer (§5.2); today's `below` row keeps the mark of the callee at `P` itself (`ap-history.md` F69) |
| D35 | the removal of the entry marks at the normal exit (§4.7 step 4, G2), on a zero-premise fact on `this` or `arg(i)` | `TaintMarkRemover` (`JIRMethodSequentFlowFunction.kt:301-314`, applied at `:156`) rejects every mark accessor of the entry-mark set that it reads, but the filter reads only the children of the root node: a non-mark accessor gets `Accept`, and `Accept` keeps the whole subtree below it (`AccessTree.kt:1031-1056`, the tree form of the default `ApMode.Tree`); the mark is the last accessor of a fact path (`AccessPathCreationUtils.kt:12-21`). So only `b.$ (m)` goes; `b.f.$ (m)` and the any child `b.[any] (m)` (the `AnyField` part of the Spring DTO source) stay | every leaf with an entry mark goes, at any depth, with both tails: `(b, p, $, m)` for every path `p`, and `(b, p, [any-taint], E, m)` with its exclusion | an entry-point source must not leak into the callers in any part (G2). Since F69 the `AnyField` part of the source is a normal `[any-taint]` fact (D32), so a leak of it gives CONFIRMED false positives in the callers. Fewer findings are possible in the callers of an entry point (`ap-history.md` F69) |

Kept as today (no deviation): the rule order at entry, call and exit; the lhs kill; the alias analyses and their use;
the constructor rule; the exception rule; the conditional exit rules at both exits, with `Result` read as `exc` at the
exceptional exit (§4.7; the unconditional exit rules: D26); the set of the entry marks (§4.3; their removal at the
exit: D35); the array elements of a call sink
argument (§4.2); the primitive mark policy at the root and below each `[e]` (§5.1); the Go pointer model; no Go type
filter; unconditional Go pass rules; the summary rewriter (except D23 and D34); the `<string-bytes>` rule; the default
getter rules; no type filter in the backward run.
