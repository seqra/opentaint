# Analyzer core — specification

Status: design spec of the new analyzer core (phase 2 of [bidirectional-task.md](../bidirectional-task.md)). This
document is normative. It uses two other specs and does not repeat them:

* [`ap.md`](ap.md): the fact, the edge, the AP operations, the runs, the stores and their theorems;
* [`interpreter.md`](interpreter.md): the micro edges of the IR and the order of the rules.

This document defines the ENTITIES of the analyzer, who owns which data, the METHOD ANALYZER, the COMMUNICATION
PIPELINE between the methods, the scheduling and the end of a run, and the ITERATION DRIVER with the hand-offs between
the runs. Appendix A gives the analysis of today's analyzer that the design starts from.

The formal model is in [`spec/lean`](lean): `Pipeline.lean`, `PipelineProofs.lean`, `PipelineAP.lean`,
`PipelineStore.lean`, `PipelineDriver.lean`, `PipelineSeeds.lean` (with `ForwardSeeds.lean`), `PipelineNDZ.lean` (with
`NDZ.lean`, `NDZeroBase.lean`), `PipelineAnyTaintEx.lean` and `PipelineAnyTaintExDriver.lean` (with the
`AnyTaintEx*.lean` files of the tail `[any-taint]` and its exclusion, and the `AnyTaint*.lean` files that they reuse,
`ap.md` §10.11), and, for the hand-off of the demand edges only, the `Handoff*.lean` files,
`PipelineHandoffDriver.lean` and `PipelineHandoffDriverExt.lean` (`ap.md` §10.12; §7.3 to §7.8). Every theorem named here
is machine-checked. [proof-status.md](proof-status.md) explains constructive
witnesses and the axiom audit, and lists the limits of each result.

The current AP rules are F72/F74/F75. Checked local contracts, historical
protocol proofs, and remaining current pipeline/driver obligations are listed in
[proof-status.md](proof-status.md). This spec defines the required behavior; it
does not claim a full current iteration proof.

## 0. Scope

The analyzer core:

1. runs one run (`ap.md` §6): one direction, one field limit, one mode (run 1 or restricted), to a fixed point. Only
   run 1 has requests. A restricted run analyses with the abstract mark `*` where its demand has a `*` pattern, and
   with a concrete mark only where a concrete-mark demand exists (§3; `ap-history.md` F72);
2. exchanges the edges between the methods of a run with no loss (§5);
3. detects the end of a run (§6);
4. runs the sequence of runs and computes the hand-off from each run to the next: only the DEMAND EDGES and the
   seeds of the DEMAND vulnerabilities (§1, §7.3, §7.4);
5. stops the sequence by its STOP RULES and by ONE BUDGET for the whole analysis: each run gets the rest of the budget
   (§7.1). It LOCALIZES the remaining work: after each complete run it logs the FRONTIER, the part of the program that
   the later runs still analyse (§7.8);
6. gives the report: the vulnerabilities and the end of the analysis (§7.5, §9).

The core is for the JVM. Go is out of scope.

Out of scope:

* the IR interpreter (`interpreter.md`); §4.9 gives only its interface to the core;
* the prescan, the rule reduction and the `TaintAnalyzer` wiring (phase 3); §9 gives the interface;
* the trace resolution. The core keeps no store of a run for a trace resolver (§7.6). The phase-3 output holds every
  entry of the report, CONFIRMED and DEMAND, and gives each one a simple trace (§9; `ap-history.md` F68);
* the iteration policy: the field limit of each run, and a practical STOP STRATEGY that reads the frontier log
  (`continueAfter`, §7.8). The driver takes the policy as a parameter (§7.1). The stop rules and the one budget are
  in scope (item 5);
* the localization of the ZERO FACT. The zero fact still enters every callee in every run (the backward rule `zin`,
  the forward zero demand, §4.4), and its work is in the frontier log only as a measure (§7.8, §7.8;
  `ap-history.md` F70).

### 0.1 Assumptions

| # | Assumption |
|---|---|
| A1 | AP operations and stores satisfy [ap.md](ap.md), including its explicit construction and demand guards. The interpreter satisfies I1–I14 in [interpreter.md](interpreter.md). The proof scope is [proof-status.md](proof-status.md). |
| A2 | LINEARIZABLE SHARED ACTIONS. Each shared action of §5.2 and §5.3 is atomic: register a handler, insert a publication, read the storage, read the handler list. All of them have one total order. This order agrees with the program order of each thread. The Lean model is an interleaving model with these actions as steps. P3 (§5.3) is the implementation rule. |
| A3 | RELIABLE EVENTS. An event that a thread sends to the channel of a runner arrives exactly once, unless the run is cancelled. The send happens before the receive (Kotlin `Channel`). |
| A4 | READ-ONLY INPUTS. These inputs do not change during a run: the program, the rules, the lambda resolutions, the demand store, the record store and the seeds. The driver makes them before the run starts. The start of the run publishes them to every runner. |
| A5 | A handler (the code of one event) ends. Only the end of a run needs this (§6). The no-loss theorem does not need it (§5.5). |

## 1. Terms

`ap.md` §1 defines the AP terms (fact, edge, premise set, layer, link, added fact, run, demand pattern, record, request,
and others; since F72 also the FLOW FORM of a `*` pattern, the FLOW PREMISE and the SHARING of the emission). This
document adds:

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| method key | `ap.md` §1: the `MethodEntryPoint` of the method (context and FORWARD entry statement). The backward run uses the same key. Its start nodes are the forward exits (§4.4). An empty method has no method key (§4.4). |
| vulnerability key | `(rule, method, statement)`: the sink rule, the METHOD of the method key (without the context) and the sink statement (§4.7). One sink statement that the analysis reaches in several contexts is ONE vulnerability. |
| sink alternative | One DNF cube of a sink rule at one place, with one array choice (`interpreter.md` §4.1, §4.2). Its index (`SinkRule.alternative`) is the same in every run and in every context (`interpreter.md` I5). |
| sink witness | One sink edge, or one sink edge set of a conjunctive sink, of one sink alternative in one method key and one run (§4.7). |
| unit | A group of methods that one runner owns (today a package; `UnitResolver`). |
| runner | The single coroutine of one unit in one run. It runs one event at a time. |
| actor | The owner of a set of objects. Each method analyzer is an actor. Its runner runs it. |
| method analyzer | The actor of one method key in one run (§4). It owns the intra-procedural edges and every RUN store of its method. |
| event | One message in the channel of a runner (§5.1). Its HANDLER is the code that the runner runs for it. |
| subscription | A caller-side record `(caller edge, call statement, added fact)` (`ap.md` §8.4). |
| publication | A summary edge that the callee gives to its subscribers. In a restricted run it is the result of the restriction (`ap.md` §6.4): the INTERSECTION of the summary edge with one demand pattern, in the locations AND the marks (`ap-history.md` F71): the premise lies inside `D-c` with its mark, and the mark of the conclusion meets the mark of `D-p` (§4.6). It carries its premise key with the tail of each member and the exclusion of an `[any-taint]` member (§4.1, §4.6). The hand-off reads the publications, not the summary edges before the restriction (§7.3, §7.4). |
| crossable | A summary leaf `j → g` (one leaf of the conclusion tree of a summary edge, `ap.md` §7.2) that the next run of EITHER direction crosses by a record, with no analysis of the callee (Lean `Handoff.Cross`). All of these hold: (1) the leaf is a leaf of a RECORD (`ap.md` §8.7 R1: a normal summary edge with one premise; a backward premise is not the zero fact); (2) the premise `j` has the tail `$`, or `*` with the Empty exclusion: not `[any]` and not a must-premise `[any-taint]`; (3) `j → g` is mark-reversible (`ap.md` §1); (4) the leaf `g` has no any tail: not `[any]`, and not `[any-taint]` with or without its exclusion. So the reversal of the leaf (`ap.md` §9.1) has a `$` or `*` (Empty) premise too. A backward leaf `jb → gb` is crossable if it is NORMAL (a backward record) and its reversal satisfies (2) to (4) (Lean `Handoff.CrossB`: the reversal `revRec` is always normal, so the test reads the layer of `gb` itself). Then the record of the leaf applies to EVERY CONCRETE added fact (forward) or requirement (backward) that covers one of its locations, by `inside` or by `applicable` (Lean `Handoff.cross_applies`, proved for the concrete runs). Since F72 a restricted run can also have an added fact or a requirement with the mark `*` or `*∖X` (§3 THE MARKS OF A RESTRICTED RUN): a record applies to it only if the premise of the record has the mark `*` (the mark test of `inside` and of `applicable`, `ap.md` §4.3); this form of `cross_applies` is PENDING (§11). The reversal of the leaf is exact (`ap.md` §8.7 R3; Lean `Reverse.rev_exact_of_empty_premise`: the converse pairs; as a record, `ap.md` S14). §7.3 shows that (4) is necessary. |
| demand edge | A published summary piece of a run that the next run of the other direction cannot reuse as a record: a publication (§4.6) of a summary leaf that is NOT crossable (Lean `Handoff.handF`, `demOfN`). Also, from a backward run, every zero-premise backward edge at the forward entry (§7.4 case 2). The run stores its demand edges when it publishes them (§4.6). The hand-off gives the next run only the demand edges (§7.3, §7.4); each one gives one demand pattern of the next run per member of its premise. The zero demand is not a demand edge: it is implicit for every method key (§4.4). A demand edge is not the same as a DEMAND-LAYER edge (`ap.md` §1): a normal leaf that is not crossable (an `[any-taint]` leaf, for example) is a demand edge too. |
| DEMAND vulnerability | A vulnerability key whose state in the report is DEMAND after a complete forward run (§7.5): the latest complete forward run reports it, and NO complete forward run so far confirmed it. A key that an earlier run confirmed is CONFIRMED (final), also when the latest run reports it only in the demand layer. Only the sink witnesses of the DEMAND vulnerabilities are sink seeds of the hand-off (§7.3). The backward run also fires the sink seeds of a sink whose end fact a requirement reaches, also of a CONFIRMED vulnerability (§4.5 THE TRIGGER OF AN END FACT). |
| frontier | The part of the program that the later runs still analyse after a complete run: the method keys with a non-zero initial fact in the run, and the demand edges that the run hands off, per method key (§7.8). The driver logs the frontier of each complete run (THE FRONTIER LOG, §7.8). |
| storage with subscription | The callee-side store of the publications, with the list of the subscribed runners (§5.2). |
| replay | The read of the storage when a subscription is new (§5.3). |
| notification | The send of a new publication to every subscribed runner (§5.2). |
| delivery | The event that carries a notification to one runner (§5.3). |
| quiescence | The state of a run with no event in a channel or a local queue, no running handler, no worklist item and no pending publication (§6.2). |
| barrier | The point between two runs: the first run is quiescent, and the next run has not started (§7.2). |
| hand-off | What one run gives to the next run: the demand edges and the seeds (`ap.md` §8, §9.2; §7.3, §7.4). The records are PERSISTENT, not a hand-off (`ap.md` §8.7): a crossable leaf goes to the records and not to the hand-off. |
| complete run | A run that ended at quiescence. A run that ended by a timeout, its memory guard or an exception (every `Throwable`, §6.3) is INCOMPLETE. An incomplete run adds nothing to the report and refutes nothing (§7.5). |

---

## 2. Entities and ownership

The layout is the layout of today: a manager, one runner per unit, one analyzer per method that keeps its own edges,
and storages with subscription between the methods. The differences: a NEW engine for each run, and one driver above
the runs.

```
IterationDriver                                   lifetime: the analysis
 ├ ApManager, MethodContextCache, RecordStore, VulnerabilityStore, executor (thread pool)
 └ for each run: RunManager(RunConfig)            lifetime: one run
     ├ summaryStorage(methodKey) → SummaryStorage one per method key, made on the first access by any thread
     └ for each unit: UnitRunner                  one coroutine
         ├ MethodAnalyzerStorage → RunMethodAnalyzer (one per method key)
         └ SubscriptionManager                    caller side: the subscriptions of the unit
```

| Entity | Lifetime | Thread | Owns | From today |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `IterationDriver` | analysis | the caller thread | the run sequence (§7) and the shared objects below | new |
| `ApManager` | analysis | any (thread-safe) | the interners of the AP (`ap.md` §7.5) | the new AP (`ap.md` §7) |
| `MethodContextCache` | analysis | the runner of the method during a run | the parts of the method context that do not depend on the run (§4.8) | split of `JIRMethodAnalysisContext` |
| `RecordStore` | analysis (PERSISTENT) | the driver writes it at a barrier; read-only during a run | the records (`ap.md` §8.7) | new |
| `VulnerabilityStore` | analysis (PERSISTENT) | any runner adds (concurrent); the driver reads it at a barrier | the sink witnesses per vulnerability key, each with its alternative, its method key and its run (§4.7) | replaces the buckets of `TaintAnalysisUnitStorage` |
| `RunManager` | one run | the caller thread and the runners | unit routing, runner spawn, the map of the `SummaryStorage`s, the in-flight counter, the run status (§6) | `TaintAnalysisUnitRunnerManager` |
| `UnitRunner` | one run | its coroutine | the event loop, its analyzers, its `SubscriptionManager` | `TaintAnalysisUnitRunner` |
| `RunMethodAnalyzer` | one run | the runner of its unit | the RUN stores of its method (§4.1) | replaces `NormalMethodAnalyzer`; `EmptyMethodAnalyzer` goes (an empty method is never analysed, §4.4) |
| `SummaryStorage` | one run | the runner of its method inserts; each subscribing runner registers and reads | the publications of one method key and the subscribed runners (§5.2) | `SummaryEdgeStorageWithSubscribers` |
| `SubscriptionManager` | one run | the runner of its unit | the subscriptions of the unit, per callee (§5.3) | `SummaryEdgeSubscriptionManager` (today two per runner, internal and external; one is enough) |
| `DemandStore` | one run, read-only | any | the demand patterns of the run (`ap.md` §8.6) | new |

Ownership rules:

* O1. A method analyzer is the only writer of its RUN stores. Only its runner calls it.
* O2. A `SummaryStorage` has one INSERTING thread: the runner of its method. A subscribing runner only registers its
  handler and reads (§5.3). `RunManager.summaryStorage(key)` makes exactly one storage per method key and run. It
  makes it atomically, on the first access by any thread (a `computeIfAbsent` on a concurrent map). The storage can
  exist before the runner of the method exists.
* O3. A `SubscriptionManager` is local to its runner. Another thread calls only its `notify`, which reads no state of
  the manager.
* O4. During a run, the other shared objects are read-only (A4), write-only (`VulnerabilityStore`), or thread-safe by
  their own contract (`ApManager`).
* O5. After a complete run, the driver reads the stores of the run that §7.6 keeps. No runner runs then (§7.2). After
  an incomplete run, the driver reads no store of the run (§7.5).

## 3. The run configuration

```kotlin
/** One run of ap.md §6.6. `Direction` is the enum of ap.md §8.7. */
class RunConfig(
    val index: Int,                          // 1, 2, 3, ...; the direction is FORWARD for an odd index
    val fieldLimit: Int,                     // ap.md §4.4; run 1 needs fieldLimit >= 1 (ap.md S12 (d))
    val demand: DemandStore?,                // null only in run 1
    val records: RecordStore,                // a read-only view; run 1 reads no record
    val seeds: SeedIndex,                    // after run 1: sink seeds (backward), source seeds (forward) (§4.7)
    val roots: List<MethodKey>,              // the root methods; the same in every run
) {
    val direction: Direction get() = if (index % 2 == 1) Direction.FORWARD else Direction.BACKWARD
    val run1: Boolean get() = index == 1
    val restricted: Boolean get() = index > 1
}
```

The mode decides these rules (`ap.md` §6.1):

| Rule | Run 1 (forward) | Restricted forward run | Backward run |
|---|---|---|---|
| initial facts of an added fact | the policy fact (`ap.md` §6.2) and the request answers | the emission of `ap.md` §6.3 (§4.4; F72 R2): an entry pattern `D-c` with the mark `*` gives its FLOW FORM, one initial fact for every added fact under it (SHARING); a `D-c` with a concrete mark gives `a ∩ D-c` with the mark of `a`, only for an `a` with that mark: an added fact with the mark `*` or `*∖X` under a concrete pattern emits NOTHING (the user's decision: "The added fact can't satisfy the demand"); the zero fact for the zero added fact | the same emission, with the requirement as the added fact: a `*` pattern weakens the requirement to the FLOW form of the pattern (§4.4); after the hand-off normalization no entry pattern has the mark `*∖X` (§7.3); the zero fact enters every callee (rule `zin`) |
| the marks of the facts | `*` and `*∖X` (the policy facts and their FLOW edges), and concrete marks (the answers, the zero fact, the sources) | NOT CONCRETE since F72: the edges of a FLOW premise (the mark `*`) have the marks `*` and `*∖X` (FLOW trees, `ap.md` §7.2), and their callees can get added facts with these marks; the edges of a concrete premise and of the zero fact have concrete marks. Before F72 every restricted run was concrete | as the restricted forward run |
| a summary applies to an added fact `a` if | `applicable(j, a)` | `inside(j, a)`; for a FLOW premise (the mark `*`) also `applicable(j, a)` (`ap.md` §4.3; F72 R3; §5.3 `matches`). This test applies after the restriction in the callee (the INTERSECTION with a demand pattern, in the locations and the marks, `ap.md` §6.4; §4.6). A callee has a non-zero premise only where a demand pattern of it emits one (§4.4): a callee whose only demand pattern is the zero demand publishes no summary of a non-zero premise, and its callers cross it by its records (next row) | as the restricted forward run; a zero-premise summary applies to the zero fact of the caller with no test and no restriction (rule `zret`) |
| records (`ap.md` §8.7 R3, R4) | none | the FORWARD records by `byEntry`, and the reversed BACKWARD records by `byExit`; each when `applicable(p, a)` or `inside(p, a)`. A forward record with an `[any-taint]` premise that applies by `applicable` only gives its results in the demand layer (`ap.md` §4.3; §4.2 `applyRecord`). A CROSSABLE leaf (§1) of the run before is not in the demand (§7.3, §7.4): its record REPLACES the analysis of the callee, and the run crosses the call by the record. A callee of which the forward run before hands off no demand edge (for example, all its summary leaves are crossable), with no seed in its call subtree, is analysed only from the zero fact (§7.8 THE EXCLUSION) | the BACKWARD records by `byEntry`, and the reversed FORWARD records by `byExit`; each when `applicable(p, a)` or `inside(p, a)`. The reversal is LEAF BY LEAF: no leaf of a forward record with an `[any-taint]` premise has a reversal; of any other record, an `[any-taint]/E` leaf with `E ≠ {}` has none, and the other leaves reverse (`ap.md` §8.7 R3; §5.3). A crossable forward leaf is not in the backward demand (§7.3): the backward run crosses the call by its reversal and never enters the callee for it |
| mark and position requests, static rule | yes (`ap.md` §4.5, §4.10); a selected-mark cleaner requests T for every same-base abstract fact, before the path test (F75) | no request rule and no static rule (F72 R4). On a fact with the mark `*` or `*∖X`, a concrete mark gate or sink gives nothing; a selected-mark cleaner keeps every same-base fact with mark `*∖(X ∪ {T})`, including disjoint paths (F75, `ap.md` §4.7). No request is raised | as the restricted forward run (the backward run has no sink check) |
| sinks | the sink check (`ap.md` §4.9) | the sink check; on a `*` or `*∖X` fact it gives nothing (no request, `ap.md` §4.9) | no sink check; the sink seeds (`ap.md` §9.2) |
| unconditional sources | every source fires | only the source seeds fire (`ap.md` §6.1 rule 6); a zero-premise forward record still applies (`ap.md` §9.2) | every reversed source edge, with no seed filter (the backward run is on the full program, Lean `Reverse.Program.rev P`); it records the source hits (`ap.md` §8.11) |
| type filters | yes | yes | no |
| the tail `[any-taint]` (`ap.md` W8, S15) | a source rule with an `[any]` target gives `[any-taint]` on a normal input: a complete edge (on a demand input `[any]`, W8). A pass rule with an `[any]` target keeps `[any]`: a may, in the demand layer (`ap.md` W6). A normal `[any-taint]` conclusion can carry an EXCLUSION `E` of first accessors, `(x, p, [any-taint], E, T)`: an exclusion edge (the keep edge of a strong write, a `*/E'` summary) gives `E ∪ E'` and the result stays normal (§4.3). Only the demotions of §4.3 make `[any]` of it (demand, no exclusion): the field-limit cut, a cleaner `part` row other than `atAndBelow` and `below` one accessor below it, a may target, a demand-layer input and (in a restricted run) the must-record demotion. No premise has the `[any-taint]` tail | as run 1. Also the `[any-taint]` premise (a MUST-PREMISE) of the emission (§4.4), with the exclusion that the emission gives it: it starts as itself in the normal layer, and its normal edges are complete | no `[any-taint]` (a forward-only tail, `ap.md` W8). The seed of an `[any]` sink pattern and the reversal of an `[any]` condition literal give `[any]`, in the demand layer (`ap.md` W6). Every result of the reversal of a micro edge whose forward target is `[any]` (a pass rule with an `AnyField` target) is in the demand layer, also a `$` result (§4.3). So is every result of the reversal of a conjunctive micro edge (§4.3). A complete edge is a normal edge, as before F69 (`ap.md` §8.7 R1) |

No run has a liveness check (§4.3).

THE MARKS OF A RESTRICTED RUN (`ap-history.md` F72; the AP rules are in `ap.md` §4.3, §4.5, §6.1, §6.3, §6.4, §6.6,
§9.2). THE RULE: a restricted run analyses with a concrete mark only if a concrete-mark demand exists. Run 1 keeps its
requests; their answers make the concrete-mark summaries where the marks matter, and the hand-off gives them to the
next run as concrete patterns (or, if they are crossable, as records). A forward demand with `*` gives a backward
demand with `*`, and a concrete demand stays concrete. The core part of each rule:

* R1, THE HAND-OFF NORMALIZATION (§7.3, §7.4). Every hand-off replaces the mark `*∖X` of a demand pattern by `*`, in
  `D-c` and in `D-p`: a larger demand, so it is sound. The summaries and the records keep `*∖X`: it blocks a mark that
  the summary cannot pass. A demand for a mark in `X` comes as its own demand edge, with the concrete mark;
* R2, THE EMISSION (§4.4). The initial fact is the WEAKEST fact inside `D-c` that covers the common part with the added
  fact (the requirement in the backward run). A `*` pattern gives its FLOW FORM, which does not depend on the added
  fact (SHARING); a concrete pattern gives `a ∩ D-c` with the mark of `a`, as before F72;
* R3, THE SATISFACTION (§5.3). A summary of a FLOW premise applies by `inside` or by `applicable`; a summary of a
  concrete premise by `inside`, as before;
* R4, NO REQUEST AFTER RUN 1, in both directions (§4.6). On a `*` or `*∖X` fact an operation that needs a concrete
  mark gives nothing (the table above);
* R5, THE RESTRICTION (§4.6). The mark-aware intersection of F71. A FLOW premise lies inside its own `*` pattern, and
  inside no concrete pattern;
* R6, THE CLAIM (PENDING, §11): every flow that needs a concrete mark is demanded by a concrete pattern or crossed by a
  concrete record, and every flow that a `*` pattern demands needs no concrete mark. So no request is needed after
  run 1, and every forward run still reports every real vulnerability that no earlier run confirmed. A sink fires only
  under a concrete premise (the method of a sink gets a concrete demand from its seed, and the chain of calls down
  stays concrete), so the confirmation does not change (§7.5).

WHAT F72 REPLACES: decision F35 (version 4), "no request after run 1, so a restricted run is CONCRETE", and its cost
(`ap.md` §6.3): NO SHARING, one initial fact per distinct added fact (path, tail, mark), so the premises are a product
of the marks. Since F72 a restricted run (forward or backward) can have `*` premises (FLOW premises), FLOW conclusions,
added facts and requirements with the marks `*` and `*∖X`, and `*∖X` marks on its summaries. Two consequences: the
backward weakening makes the backward demand coarser (for example the requirement `ret.*` in place of `ret`, §7.4), and
the restricted runs have no request rules. The current base rules are defined; their full mode/iteration proofs remain open (§11).

---

## 4. The method analyzer

The method analyzer `RunMethodAnalyzer` replaces `NormalMethodAnalyzer`. It keeps the pattern of today: the
intra-procedural edges stay inside the analyzer, the analyzer has a worklist, and its runner runs it in steps. One
class serves every direction and every mode. The `RunConfig` gives the differences of the mode. The direction changes
only the forms that the analyzer reads: the forward forms of the interpreter, or their reversals (§4.9).

### 4.1 State

| Field | Store | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `edges` | method edge store (`ap.md` §8.1) | the edges, keyed per kind (`ap.md` §7.2): REACH per (statement, premise key, layer); FLOW per (statement, premise key, layer, base, exclusion, mark exclusion); TAINT per (statement, premise key, layer, base), and a normal TAINT tree also per the one exclusion of its `[any-taint]` leaves (`ap.md` §7.2) |
| `initials` | initial fact store (`ap.md` §8.2) | the initial facts of the run: zero, emissions, answers |
| `links` | added fact store (`ap.md` §8.3) | each added fact with its links: the caller reference and the layer of the added fact on the link |
| `summaries` | run summary store (`ap.md` §8.5) | two parts: the summary edges BEFORE the restriction, per premise key and layer (`persist` takes the records from them, `ap.md` §8.7 R1), and the DEMAND EDGES of the run: the published pieces of the summary leaves that are not crossable (§1, §4.6; `ap-impl.md` DD17, `RunSummaryStore.addDemand`, `demandEdges()`). The hand-off reads only the demand edges (§7.3, §7.4) |
| `counters` | | the counters of the frontier log (§7.8) and of the stop rule `NO_DEMAND_EDGE` (§7.1): the DEMAND-LAYER OBJECTS of the run (the deltas of `edges.add` in the demand layer, the summary deltas in the demand layer (§4.6) and the new DEMAND LINKS, the links whose added fact is in the demand layer, §4.2 `addLink`, `ap.md` §8.3), the crossable summary leaves (counted at each summary delta, §4.6), the record applications at a call (§4.2 `applyRecord`), a flag that is true if a non-zero initial fact exists, the edges of the zero premise; as an option, the demand-layer results per demotion (§4.3) |
| `requests` | request store (`ap.md` §8.8) | run 1 only: the standing mark and position requests and their answers |
| `sourceHits` | source hit store (`ap.md` §8.11) | backward run only: the unconditional sources of this method that a requirement reached |
| `conjunctions` | conjunction store (`ap.md` §8.9) | the standing literal inputs per (conjunctive micro edge or sink alternative, statement, literal index), with the evaluated `S` parts of the exit sinks (§4.7); the combinations of the callee summaries with several premises (§5.4) |
| `worklist` | `DeltaWorklist` (§4.3, §10) | the edge deltas to process: the `unchanged` queue with its set, and the `normal` queue |
| `pendingPublications` | | the publications that the analyzer has not yet given to its `SummaryStorage` (§4.6) |
| `queued` | | true while the analyzer has a `Work` event in its runner (§6.2) |
| `context` | `MethodContextCache` entry and run part | the method graph, the alias analysis, the lambda resolutions, the rule context of the run (§4.8) |

The subscriptions are not in the analyzer. They are in the `SubscriptionManager` of the runner of the caller
(`ap.md` §8.4; §5.3).

THE PREMISE KEY HOLDS THE TAIL AND THE EXCLUSION. An `[any-taint]` premise (a MUST-PREMISE) with its exclusion `E` and
an `[any]` premise with the same base, path and mark are two different premise keys (`InitialAp` with the tail
`ANY_TAINT` and the exclusion `E`, or with the tail `ANY`, `ap.md` §7.1). Two must-premises of one path with different
exclusions are two premise keys too. Two added facts of one method (an `[any-taint]` one and an `[any]` one) can give
them at one path. So `initials` holds both, and every store of the table that has the premise key in its key
(`edges`, `summaries`, `conjunctions`) keeps them apart. A forward run only: the backward run has no `[any-taint]`.
Lean: the must flag and the exclusion of the objects `AnyTaintEx.XObj` (`init M j must jex`, `edge M j must jex n f`).

### 4.2 Handlers

The runner calls these handlers. Each handler is part of one event (§5.1).

| Handler | When | Actions | `ap.md` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `addRootZero()` | the run starts at a root | the zero fact is an initial fact | §6.1 |
| `addLink(link)` | a caller binds a fact into this method | add the link (exact deduplication). A new added fact: emit its initial facts (§4.4). A new link: check the standing requests (§4.6). A new link whose added fact is in the demand layer (a DEMAND LINK, `ap.md` §8.3) adds one to the demand-layer objects of `counters` (§4.1; the stop rule `NO_DEMAND_EDGE`, §7.1). The zero added fact emits the zero fact. No request matches it. Its link serves the support (§7.5). | E1, E2 |
| `addZeroEntry()` | backward: the zero fact of a caller reaches a call to this method | the zero fact is an initial fact (rule `zin`) | §9.2 |
| `addRequest(premise, request)` | run 1: a callee climbs a request through a link of this method | store it (exact deduplication); check it against every link of this method (§4.6) | E5, E7 |
| `applySummary(sub, pub)` | the `SubscriptionManager` matched a publication with a subscription of this method | one premise: apply the summary to the added fact (`ap.md` §4.3), then the stages after the callees stage (§4.5). Several premises: the combination of §5.4. | §4.3, E2, E4, E6 |
| `applyRecord(sub, record)` | a new subscription of this method; the record (already reversed by the `SubscriptionManager` if it is from the other direction) covers or contains its added fact | apply the record, then the stages after the callees stage (§4.5). A record with an `[any-taint]` premise whose premise covers the added fact (`applicable`) but does not lie inside it with the exclusions (not `inside`) gives each result in the demand layer: the result keeps its base, path and mark, and its layer goes up (an `[any-taint]` result becomes `[any]` and loses its exclusion, `ap.md` W8; the must-premise needs every location; Lean `AnyTaintEx.recLayerX`, necessary by `AnyTaintExact.CexApp.cex_app`). Each application with a result is a RECORD CROSSING: it adds one to `counters` (§4.1; the frontier log, §7.8) | §4.3, §8.7 R3, R4 |
| `step(quantum)` | a `Work` event | process at most `quantum` worklist items (§4.3) | §6.1 (S6: any order) |

A new initial fact `j` (from any handler) is event E3: the analyzer adds the start edges of `j` to the worklist
(§4.4).

### 4.3 The worklist and the step

* An item of the worklist is an edge delta (`EdgeDelta`, §10): (premise key, layer, node, conclusions). The
  conclusions are one of the kinds of `ap.md` §7.2: REACH, a FLOW tree or a TAINT tree. The edge is the fact BEFORE
  the statement of the node, as today.
* `edges.add` returns the delta of the merge (`ap.md` §7.2 T4). A null delta adds nothing, and the analyzer drops it.
  Else the analyzer adds the delta to the `normal` queue of the worklist.
* NO LIVENESS CHECK. No run drops a fact because its local is not live at the node. (Today the forward runs prune by
  `isReachable` of `JIRLocalVariableReachability`.) The alias analysis does not change: it keeps its own inputs, as
  today (§4.8). This is a decision (`ap-history.md` F67).
* The step takes one item and applies its node:
  * a non-call statement: the statement transfer (`ap.md` §4.2; `interpreter.md` §2, §4.4; the STATEMENT mode of
    §4.9) with the primitives that the interpreter puts at the statement (`interpreter.md` §5); then the field limit
    at the cut points (`ap.md` §4.4);
  * a call statement: the call steps (§4.5).
* THE LAYER OF AN ANY-TAIL RESULT (`ap.md` W6, W8). The AP sets it on each application of a micro edge, in every mode
  of §4.9.
  * FORWARD. The result of a micro edge with an `[any]` target (a may: a pass rule with an `AnyField` target) goes to
    the demand layer; the result of a micro edge with an `[any-taint]` target (a source rule, `ap.md` S15) keeps its
    layer. A demand-layer result with the `[any-taint]` tail becomes `[any]` and loses its exclusion. An exclusion does
    not demote a normal `[any-taint]/E` fact: the result carries the exclusion and keeps its layer (`ap.md` §4.1, §4.2,
    §4.7): an exclusion edge at the path of the fact gives `E ∪ E'`; the case below keeps `E`; the case above applies
    only if `E` admits the step down and gives the exclusion of the edge; a read through an accessor in `E` gives
    nothing, a read through another accessor gives the empty exclusion; a copy of the object keeps `E`; the cleaners
    `atAndBelow` and `below` at `P.f` add `f` to `E` (`below` also keeps `(x, P.f, $, T)`). These rows are not
    demotions. THE DEMOTIONS: only these operations make `[any]` of an `[any-taint]` fact, in the demand layer and
    with no exclusion (`ap.md` §2.2 THE DEMOTIONS):
    * the field-limit cut (`ap.md` §4.4);
    * a cleaner `part` row of `ap.md` §4.7 other than the `atAndBelow` and `below` rows one accessor below the fact: so
      the `exact` cleaner at the path of the fact or one accessor below it, and every cleaner two or more accessors
      below it;
    * a may target: the `[any]` target of a pass rule (W6);
    * a demand-layer input: a demand fact (also another input of a conjunction), a demand-layer summary edge or
      record, a demand link (an `[any]` added fact);
    * the must-record demotion (a restricted run; §4.2 `applyRecord`).

    Lean: `AnyTaintEx.w6tX`, `transferX`, `limitFX`, `cleanResX` (`partX`), `recLayerX`; the rows `AnyTaintEx.annX`.
  * BACKWARD. The run has no `[any-taint]` (`ap.md` W8). Every result of a reversed micro edge whose FORWARD target is
    `[any]` goes to the demand layer, whatever its tail, also a `$` result (`ap.md` §9.1): the may belongs to the
    forward rule. W6 puts every `[any]` result in the demand layer. The reversal of a source edge (forward target
    `[any-taint]`, a must) follows the ordinary rows of `ap.md` §4.1. This rule is argued, as the backward W6 (§11).
    THE REVERSAL OF A CONJUNCTION (`ap.md` §9.1; `ap-history.md` F70). The reversal of a CONJUNCTIVE micro edge with
    two or more positive literals (also of a conjunctive exit source, §4.4) gives EVERY result in the demand layer, as
    the reversal of a may: a requirement that reaches one literal is not a converse flow of the conjunction. So no
    backward summary through it is a record (`ap.md` §8.7 R1) or crossable (§1), and the hand-off gives it to the next
    forward run (§7.4 case 3), which analyses the callee with all the members. This fixes a false positive that
    existed before F70: a normal backward summary from the conclusion to ONE literal was a record, and its reversal
    (R3) was a forward record of one literal, which drops the other literals (§11). Argued (§11).

  The core reads the target tail of the FORWARD form of the micro edge (`MicroEdge.forward`, §4.9): `[any]` is a may
  (a pass rule), `[any-taint]` a must (a source). The reversed literal of a conjunctive edge carries
  `MicroEdge.conjunctive` (§4.9), a property of the form (the reversal made it), not of the rule kind. So the core
  needs no rule-kind flag, in either direction.
* A result AT AN END NODE of the run (§4.4) goes through the end rules and makes the summary edges (§4.6). This holds
  for every handler that makes such a result: `step`, and also `applySummary`, `applyRecord` and `zret` when the end
  node is a call (for example a backward end node whose forward entry statement is a call). An end node is a
  statement like every other: its transfer or its call steps come first. (Today: `handleStatementEdge`, the edge
  post-processor, then `tryEmmitSummaryEdge`; the new core has no post-processor.)
* A forward result AT AN EXCEPTIONAL EXIT goes through the exit rules of that exit (`interpreter.md` §4.7 steps 1 and
  2: the exit sources, the exit sinks and their end facts, with `Result` read as `exc`; the unconditional exit rules
  fire there on the zero fact, `interpreter.md` D26). Its results end there: an exceptional exit is not an end node
  and makes no summary edge.
* Each result goes to every successor node in the graph of the run, through `edges.add`.
* THE UNCHANGED PATH stays as today (`ap.md` §8.1). If the statement does not touch the base of an edge, the
  analyzer puts the edge for each successor into the `unchanged` queue with no `edges.add` (today
  `addSequentialUnchangedEdge`). The new core has no edge post-processor (`interpreter.md` D14), so an unchanged edge
  always goes on as it is.
* THE TWO QUEUES. The worklist (`DeltaWorklist`, §10) has two queues:
  * `unchanged`: the items of the unchanged path. A SET discards the repetitions: an item that the set holds does not
    go into the queue again (today `enqueuedUnchangedEdges`);
  * `normal`: the deltas of `edges.add`. The zero-to-zero items (REACH on `{zero}`) come first, then the other items
    in LIFO order, as today.

  The step always takes an `unchanged` item while that queue is not empty. The step takes a `normal` item only when
  the `unchanged` queue is empty. When the step finds the `unchanged` queue empty (after the last `unchanged` item
  put its successors into the queues), the analyzer drops the set (it starts a new empty set). The set stays at the
  end of a `Work` event (today the event end resets it). So a loop of statements that do not touch a base ends: the
  set holds the items of the loop until the `unchanged` queue is empty.
* The analyzer does not delay an edge by its depth. There is no fact-depth limit: the field limit of the run is the
  only depth bound (`ap.md` §4.4; `bidirectional-task.md` §5 item 1).

### 4.4 Initial facts, start nodes and start rules

For each new added fact, run 1 uses AP §6.2 and later runs use AP §6.3.
The restricted emission query is `near(base::path)` (AP §8.6); run the full
emission test on every candidate. A `*` pattern shares one FLOW premise; a
concrete pattern emits only a concrete matching added mark. No restricted request
is raised. Enforce AP §6.1's normalized-pattern and entry-tail guards.

`initials.add` deduplicates exact initial facts. Each new initial fact starts as
AP §6.5 specifies, at every start node of its kind, then takes the start rules.
Request answers add initial facts only in run 1. Zero demand is implicit for every
forward method key; root zero is initial. Backward `addZeroEntry` enters zero
directly at each reached callee exit, without emission. A method whose only
forward demand is `(zero,none)` has only zero initial facts; its callers can still
read its records. Backward zero-premise seed paths can return to callers.

Start nodes, end nodes and their rules. The interpreter gives the forward ones; the backward ones are their reversal
(§4.9):

| Direction | Start nodes | Start rules | End nodes | End rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| forward | the entry statement of the method key | the ENTRY RULES (`interpreter.md` §4.3): the zero fact with the entry sinks and the entry-point sources; another fact with the filter by the context type | every normal exit | the EXIT RULES (`interpreter.md` §4.7). The exit rules also apply at an exceptional exit, with `Result` read as `exc`, but it is not an end node: no summary |
| backward | the zero fact: every forward exit, normal and exceptional (`ap.md` S4). Another initial fact: every normal exit (exceptions are out of scope, `interpreter.md` G1) | the reversed exit rules of that exit (normal or exceptional): the reversed exit sources and end-fact edges; and the sink seeds of its exit sinks (§4.7), which then take the reversed exit sources of that exit too (`interpreter.md` §4.9 SEEDS) | the forward entry statement | the reversed entry rules: the reversed entry-point sources and end-fact edges (no context filter: the backward run has no type filter) |

The exits: the normal exit is `JMethodExitNormalInst`; the exceptional exit is `JMethodExitExceptionalInst`.

THE BOUNDARY RULE STATEMENTS. The entry rules and the exit rules are rule statements in the STATEMENT mode (§4.9). Their
touched bases and keep edges are those of `interpreter.md` §4.3 and §4.7 (`ap-impl.md` §29, `keep`): the zero base with
its keep edge; at the exit, each base that a literal of an exit source reads, with the identity edge `b.* → b.*`; at the
start, each base with a context filter, with the identity edge and that filter as its operand filter. A source target
is a gen-only target (not touched). So a fact on a read base stays in the worklist (`interpreter.md` §4.7 step 1), an
initial fact passes unchanged or passes its context filter, and in the backward run a requirement on a read base or on a
target passes.

A CONJUNCTIVE EXIT SOURCE (an exit source with two or more positive literals in one alternative of its condition) is an
ND edge at the exit, as at a call (`interpreter.md` §4.7 step 1, D31; `ap-history.md` F68). It is a `ConjunctiveEdge`
of the exit rules (`RuleStatement.summary.conjunctions`, §4.9). Each literal stores its input in the conjunction store of
the method key, per (edge, exit statement, literal index) (`ap.md` §8.9). A full combination is an exit item with the
union of the premise sets (without the zero fact, `ap.md` §4.6), after the field limit. It goes through the exit steps 2
to 5 (`interpreter.md` §4.7) and becomes a summary at the normal exit, an ND summary if its premise set has two or more
members; the callers apply it by E6 (§5.4). At the exceptional exit it goes through step 2 only and ends there (§4.3).
It is not a rule error. The backward run reverses it into one micro edge per literal (`StatementSummary.reversed`,
§4.9), and every result of such a reversed edge is in the demand layer (§4.3 THE REVERSAL OF A CONJUNCTION).

The backward graph is the reversed graph (`ApplicationGraph.reversed`) with the EXIT WIRING. A node that reaches no
forward exit gets an edge to an exceptional exit (`interpreter.md` I11 (e); today `JIRBackwardExitWiringGraph` on
`saloed/backward-main`). Only the zero fact uses an exceptional exit. The `MethodContextCache` keeps the wired graph per
method (today the code computes the wiring again on every call).

AN EMPTY METHOD (no instruction: a native method, an abstract method, a method with no body) cannot be analysed. The
core never analyses it: it has no method key, no method analyzer and no `SummaryStorage`, and it is never a root. The
call resolver never resolves a call to an empty method: it drops the empty method from the callees of the call (§4.5).
So a call with an empty and a non-empty resolution result enters only the non-empty callee, and a flow through the empty
target is lost (`interpreter.md` G12). If every resolution result of a call is an empty method, the call is an
UNRESOLVED call (`interpreter.md` §3.7: the pass rules and the default identity). This is a decision (`ap-history.md`
F67). Today `EmptyMethodAnalyzer` publishes the identity summaries of the most abstract facts.

### 4.5 The call plan

A call is a small graph: six POINTS and the STAGES between them. This is the CALL PLAN. The interpreter gives the
FORWARD plan (`interpreter.md` §4.5, §4.6). The backward plan is its REVERSAL (`CallPlan.reversed`, §4.9). It gives the
backward call order of `interpreter.md` §4.9 step by step, so the analyzer runs one algorithm in both directions.

| Point | Coordinates | Content in the forward plan |
|---|---|---|
| `BEFORE` | caller | the caller fact before the call |
| `BOUND` | callee | the bound fact, before the cleaners; the RULE POINT of the call (its sinks) |
| `ADDED` | callee | the added fact: the entry of the callee |
| `RETURNED` | callee | a result of the callee: a summary result or an unresolved result |
| `REWRITTEN` | callee | a result after the summary rewriter |
| `AFTER` | caller | the result in the caller, before the field limit |

The forward stages of a JVM call `r = m(o, a1, …, an)` (the step numbers of `interpreter.md` §4.5):

| Stage | Forward | Content | Step |
|---|---|---|---|
| binding in | `BEFORE → BOUND` | the binding edges into the callee (with the zero binding), with the caller-side type filters (`interpreter.md` §3.1) | 2 |
| end facts | `BOUND → REWRITTEN` | the end-fact edges of the sinks of the call; GUARD: the sink triggers. It takes no input fact (THE END-FACT STAGE, below) | 3 |
| sources | `BOUND → REWRITTEN` | the rule statement of the call: the sources and the conjunctions (`interpreter.md` §4.1) | 4 |
| cleaners | `BOUND → ADDED` | the cleaners and the `RemoveAllMarks` kill on `S`, in the rule order | 5.1 |
| callees | `ADDED → RETURNED` | the resolved callees (with the lambdas of the prescan), never an empty method (§4.4): SUBSCRIBE and LINK (below) | 5.2 |
| unresolved | `ADDED → RETURNED` | the statement summary of the unresolved callee (`interpreter.md` §3.7); also of a call whose every resolution result is an empty method (§4.4) | 5.3 |
| constructor | `ADDED → REWRITTEN` | JVM `<init>`: the identity of every bound position (`S`, the receiver, the arguments); it skips the callee and the rewriter (`interpreter.md` §3.5) | 5.2 |
| rewriter | `RETURNED → REWRITTEN` | the summary rewriter (`interpreter.md` §5.2) | 6 |
| binding back | `REWRITTEN → AFTER` | the binding edges back, with the result-side type filters | 6 |
| aliases | `REWRITTEN → AFTER` | the alias edges `P.* → b.q.*` (`interpreter.md` §3.8 AC2); GUARD: the selection of AC3 and AC4 (THE ALIAS GUARD, below) | 6 |

The plan also has its TOUCHED caller bases (`S`, `o`, every `ai`, `r`; step 1) and the SINKS of the call at `BOUND`
(step 3).

HOW THE ANALYZER RUNS A PLAN (both directions):

* A caller fact on a base that the plan does not touch passes over the call (step 1). The zero base is never touched.
* A fact at a point goes through every stage that starts at that point. Each result arrives at the end point of its
  stage. The stages that start at one point read the same facts, so their order does not matter. (So the sinks see
  the uncleaned bound fact, as `interpreter.md` §4.5 asks.)
* An `Edges` stage applies its summary in the STAGE mode (§4.9 THE APPLICATION MODES): only its edges give results.
  The touched bases of the plan do the pass-over (step 1). The kill on `S` in the cleaners stage applies in the
  STATEMENT mode.
* A fact at the exit point of the plan gets the field limit and goes to the return node of the call.
* The callees stage is not local: SUBSCRIBE and LINK, and its results arrive later through `applySummary` and
  `applyRecord`, at its end point.
* At the rule point `BOUND`, the forward run checks the sinks of the call (§4.7). The backward run checks no sink: it
  fires the sink seeds of these sinks there (§4.7).
* The sources stage applies the source seeds (forward restricted run) and records the source hits (backward run) (§4.7).

THE END-FACT STAGE (`BOUND → REWRITTEN`) takes no input fact. Its trigger is a sink of the call at `BOUND`: a sink edge
of a plain sink, or a new full combination of a conjunctive sink (§4.7). On a trigger, the analyzer applies the
end-fact edges of that sink to the zero fact, in the layer of the sink edge or of the combination (`ap.md` §2.2,
§4.9). Each result is a zero-to-fact edge (premise set `{zero}`), and it arrives at `REWRITTEN`. The same rule holds
for the end facts of the entry sinks and of the exit sinks (§4.4). The backward run has no trigger: the reversed
end-fact edges apply to every requirement (THE REVERSAL, below).

THE TRIGGER OF AN END FACT (`ap.md` §9.2; `ap-history.md` F70). An end fact exists only after its sink triggers, so
its reversal must demand the trigger. When the reversed end-fact edge of a sink alternative `A` at the statement `s`
of the method key `M` applies to a requirement, it gives the zero fact (as before), and the analyzer also fires the
sink seeds of `A` at `(M, s)` (SINK SEEDS, §4.7), once per `(M, s, A)`. So the next forward run demands the witness of
the trigger, also when the vulnerability of `A` is CONFIRMED. The seeds of the hand-off do not change: only the DEMAND
vulnerabilities are seeded at the barrier (§7.3). The same rule holds for the reversed end-fact edges of an entry sink
and of an exit sink (§4.4); an unconditional sink (an entry sink, for example) has no sink seed (§4.7), so its trigger
needs only the zero fact. The analyzer makes these seeds from the forms of the sink (`SinkRule.patterns`), not from
the `SeedIndex`, so A4 holds. Argued: the model has no end facts (§4.5; [proof-status.md](proof-status.md)).

THE ALIAS GUARD (`Guard.MemoryEffect`; `interpreter.md` §3.8 AC3, AC4). Each forward result at `REWRITTEN` has an
ORIGIN (`Origin`, §4.9): the stage that made it. The sources stage gives SOURCE, the end-fact stage END_FACT, a pass
rule of the unresolved stage PASS. The default identity of the unresolved stage and the constructor stage give
IDENTITY. A summary result or a record result (the callees stage) is an IDENTITY only in one case: it is in the NORMAL
layer, and it is equal to the start fact of its premise (`ap.md` §6.5). Every other summary result has a memory effect
(SUMMARY_EFFECT): a DEMAND-layer result always goes to the aliases, and so does every result of a zero-premise
summary (`ap-history.md` F67). The cleaners and the rewriter keep the origin of their input. The alias stage takes
every result whose origin is not IDENTITY.

THE REVERSAL (`CallPlan.reversed`; the rules of `ap.md` §9.1, §9.2):

* The entry point and the exit point change places (backward: `AFTER` is the entry, `BEFORE` the exit). Each stage goes
  from its forward end point to its forward start point.
* A micro-edge stage gets the reversed summary (`StatementSummary.reversed`, §4.9).
* A GUARD is a forward-only selection, so the reversal drops it: the reversed alias edges apply to every requirement
  (`interpreter.md` AC5), and the reversed end-fact edges too. A reversed end-fact edge that applies also fires the
  sink seeds of its sink (THE TRIGGER OF AN END FACT, above). The reversal also drops every type filter.
* A primitive cleaner is its own reversal. Reverse the action order in the cleaners stage and the rewriter.
  A field action is reversed write, clean temporary, reversed read (F74); reverse each statement summary.
  The static kill keeps its keep edges.
* The callees stage stays the same: in the backward run it gives the backward summaries.
* The sinks stay at `BOUND`.
* The touched bases: the forward touched bases and the alias bases (the target bases of a stage that ends at the
  forward exit and that the forward plan does not touch). Forward, an alias base passes over the call. Backward, its
  requirement passes over by the PASS-OVER stage `AFTER → BEFORE` (kind `PASS_OVER`, §4.9), with the identity edge
  `b.* → b.*` of each alias base (`interpreter.md` A5). This stage is the exact reversal of the forward pass-over. A
  target base that the forward plan touches (an argument, `S`) gets no pass-over.

The reversed plan is the backward call order of `interpreter.md` §4.9:

| Backward step (`interpreter.md` §4.9) | Reversed stage |
|---|---|
| 1 relevance | the reversed touched bases |
| 1 the pass-over of the alias bases that the forward plan does not touch | `AFTER → BEFORE` |
| 2 reversed binding back and alias edges | `AFTER → REWRITTEN` |
| 3 reversed sources and end-fact edges; their results arrive at step 7 | `REWRITTEN → BOUND` |
| 4 reversed rewriter | `REWRITTEN → RETURNED` |
| 5.1 resolved callees | `RETURNED → ADDED` |
| 5.2 unresolved callee | `RETURNED → ADDED` |
| 5.3 JVM constructor: from step 2 to step 6 | `REWRITTEN → ADDED` |
| 6 reversed cleaners and the keep edges of the kill | `ADDED → BOUND` |
| 7 the seeds and the read positions | the rule point `BOUND` |
| 8 reversed binding in | `BOUND → BEFORE` |
| 9 the field limit | the exit point `BEFORE` |

The core reverses only a forward plan. The reversal is not an involution: it drops the guards and the filters, and it
adds identity edges.

SUBSCRIBE: the analyzer gives the subscription `(caller edge, s, a)` for the callee `m` to the `SubscriptionManager`
of its runner (§5.3). The replay applies the publications of `m` that `a` satisfies, and the records of `m` that apply
to `a`.

LINK: the analyzer sends the link `(a, caller edge)` to `m`. For `m` in another unit, it sends the event `LinkIn`. For
`m` in the same unit, it may call `m.addLink` directly (as today `submitMethodInitialFact`; §6.1 permits it).

The zero fact at a call. The zero base is not touched, so the zero fact passes over the call in both directions (rule
`zpass` in the backward run). It also acts at the rule point:

* forward: the zero binding takes it to `BOUND`. There the unconditional sinks fire, and the sources stage fires on it
  (in a forward restricted run, only the source seeds, §4.7). No cleaner acts on the zero base, so it goes on to
  `ADDED` and enters every resolved callee: a subscription and a link;
* backward: the zero fact at the call fires the sink seeds at `BOUND` (§4.7); they go on through the reversed binding
  in. The analyzer adds a ZERO SUBSCRIPTION for each resolved callee `m` (it matches the zero-premise publications of
  `m`, §5.3) and sends `ZeroIn` to `m` (rule `zin`). A zero-premise publication applies to the zero fact of the caller
  with no test (rule `zret`). Its results arrive at `ADDED`, the end point of the reversed callees stage.

### 4.6 Summary edges, publications and requests

After end rules, handle each raw summary delta `j→g` (event E4) in this order:

1. Add the raw delta to `summaries`. Count its demand-layer objects and its raw
   record-eligible leaves (§4.1).
2. Determine persistence eligibility (R1) and crossability (R5) separately on
   raw leaves using [ap.md](ap.md) §8.7. Persistable normal leaves remain available
   at the barrier; only crossable leaves replace next-run analysis.
3. Build publications: run 1 publishes raw leaves; a restricted run publishes
   each result of AP §6.4 for the demand patterns returned by AP §8.6's query.
   A backward `{zero}`-premise balanced return publishes raw leaves (AP §9.2).
4. Select **raw non-crossable** leaves with `demandPart`, then apply the same
   publication rule to them and store their pieces with `addDemand`. Eligibility
   is not recalculated after reduction. The hand-off reads these stored pieces.
5. Enqueue publications and flush them to `SummaryStorage` before the `Work`
   handler ends (§6.2 W3).

Publications retain the complete premise key, including each tail, must flag, and
field exclusion. Reduction reads the whole premise, conclusion marks, and field
exclusions; its rules and representability limits have one definition in AP §6.4.
A `*` entry pattern can publish FLOW and concrete premises inside it; a concrete
pattern cannot publish a FLOW premise. For several premise members, query the
union of candidates for each member. Apply AP §6.4's member-wise restriction,
testing each selected whole member, and retain the complete premise set. The
query never replaces that test.

Requests exist only in run 1 (AP §§4.5,4.10,8.8). Insert each new request and join
it with every overlapping link; a new link joins every standing request. Both
sides are local to one method analyzer. Each pair gives an ANSWER, CLIMB to the
caller premise, or nothing, as AP defines. Requests use the pre-operation incoming
premise, including cleaner requests (AP §4.7).

A restricted analyzer has no request store or request events. An operation needing
a concrete mark gives no concrete branch for an abstract input. The F75 cleaner
still propagates the same-base abstract residual with the selected mark excluded.
Preserving the needed concrete branch is the mode obligation in AP §6.6.

### 4.7 Sinks, vulnerabilities, seeds and source hits

* A triggered sink adds its WITNESS to the `VulnerabilityStore` under the VULNERABILITY KEY `(rule, method,
  statement)` (`ap.md` §8.10). `method` is the method of the method key, WITHOUT the context. So one sink statement
  that the analysis reaches in several contexts is ONE vulnerability (`ap-history.md` F67). A witness is one sink edge,
  or the sink edge set of a conjunctive sink. Each witness names its sink ALTERNATIVE (`SinkRule.alternative`, §4.9),
  its METHOD KEY and its RUN. The confirmation of a witness reads the support of its premise set in its own method key
  (§7.5).
* The store keeps several witnesses for one vulnerability key: one entry per (vulnerability key, alternative, method
  key, run, shape). The SHAPE of a witness is the list of the premise set, the layer and the group key of the facts
  (`ap.md` §8.1: the base, the kind and the layer) of each of its sink edges. Two witnesses of one entry merge their
  sink facts. The confirmation reads only the method key, the premise sets and the layers, so this merge changes no
  confirmation. Witnesses of different alternatives or of different method keys never merge, so a merge never joins
  two group keys at one literal.
* A conjunctive sink uses the conjunction store, per (sink alternative, statement, literal index). Each sink edge set
  is one witness (`ap.md` §4.9).
* THE GLOBAL-STATE RULE (exit sinks; `interpreter.md` §4.7 step 3, D30). At a normal exit, the analyzer drops the
  EVALUATED statics of a ZERO-PREMISE item: if a part of an item on the static base `S` whose premise is the zero fact
  (a state that the method or its callees set) satisfies a mark literal (`ContainsMark`, `ContainsMarkOnAnyField`) of
  an exit sink, plain or conjunctive, the analyzer drops that part from the summary edge. The rest of the item stays.
  For a conjunctive exit sink, the analyzer also stores the evaluated part as the input of that literal in the
  conjunction store. A stored input is an assumption for the later evaluations of the sink: a later item can complete
  the combination with it. The analyzer drops the part also when the combination is not complete (`ap-history.md`
  F67).
* A CALLER-SET `S` FACT (an item on `S` whose premise is not the zero fact) is evaluated: it can report
  (`interpreter.md` D21), and a conjunctive literal stores it as an input. The analyzer does not drop it: it returns to
  the caller through the callee summary, in run 1 also through the FLOW summary and its record (§7.4 THE STATIC BASE)
  (`ap-history.md` F68). As today: today's exit sinks run only on zero-premise edges
  (`JIRMethodExitRuleProvider.kt:18-19`), and only a reached sink drops (`JIRSequentTaintUtil.kt:76-85`). The false
  positives that this keeps (a later sink in the caller sees the state; the exit sink of the caller evaluates it again)
  are expected (`interpreter.md` G2, `ap.md` §11.1).
* SEEDS. After run 1, every run has seeds. The driver gives a `SeedIndex` per (method key, statement):
  * a backward run: the SINK SEEDS, the requirements of the sink witnesses of the DEMAND vulnerabilities after the
    forward run before (§1, §7.3; `ap.md` §9.2). A CONFIRMED vulnerability gives no seed of the hand-off: its state
    is final (§7.5). The backward run also fires, by itself, the sink seeds of a sink alternative whose reversed
    end-fact edge applies to a requirement, also of a CONFIRMED vulnerability (§4.5 THE TRIGGER OF AN END FACT).
    A sink pattern gives one requirement. A conjunctive sink gives one requirement per positive
    literal. An unconditional sink gives none. The requirement of an `[any]` sink pattern (`ContainsMarkOnAnyField`)
    has the tail `[any]`: the backward run has no `[any-taint]` (`ap.md` W8, §9.2), so its seed is in the demand
    layer (`ap.md` W6), as before F69. The seeds of a witness are at its method key and its statement;
  * a forward restricted run: the SOURCE SEEDS, the unconditional sources that the backward run before reached
    (`ap.md` §6.1 rule 6, §8.11).
* A sink seed enters as a zero-to-fact edge where the zero fact reaches its statement, cut by the field limit. A call
  sink seeds at the rule point `BOUND` of the reversed plan (§4.5). An exit sink seeds in the start rules (§4.4). A
  sink seed of the trigger of an end fact (§4.5) enters in the same way, at the place of its sink.
* A source seed is a filter on the SOURCES: the micro edges whose forward form (`MicroEdge.forward`, §4.9) goes from
  the zero fact to another base. In a forward restricted run, the analyzer applies a source only if `SeedIndex` has
  its forward form for that (method key, statement). The sources are at a statement (a read source, an exit source),
  in the sources stage of a call (§4.5) and in the entry and exit rules. The end facts of a sink and every other micro
  edge apply as usual.
* SOURCE HITS (backward run). When the analyzer applies a reversed source to a requirement and gets a result, it adds
  `(method key, statement, forward form)` to `sourceHits` (`ap.md` §8.11). This holds at each place of a reversed
  source: a statement, the reversed sources stage of a call (§4.5), and the reversed exit and entry rules (§4.4). The
  analyzer records the hit whatever `edges.add` gives: also when the store drops the zero result as a duplicate.
* The backward run has no sink check.
* THE SINK CHECK ON A `*` FACT (a forward restricted run; F72 R4). The check needs a concrete effective mark
  (`ap.md` §4.9). On a fact whose effective mark is `*` or `*∖X` it gives nothing and raises no request. A FLOW
  premise has only edges with abstract marks (§3), so no sink edge has a FLOW premise in its premise set: a sink
  fires only under a concrete premise or the zero fact (R6; PENDING, §11).

### 4.8 The method context

Today `JIRMethodAnalysisContext` holds the alias analysis, the local-variable reachability, the lambda resolutions,
the flow-function caches and the taint rule context. The new core splits it:

* the CACHED part, in `MethodContextCache`:
  * per method: the method graph, the alias analysis (with its own inputs, as today: the local-variable reachability is
    one of them; the core does not read it, §4.3), the lambda resolutions of the prescan and the wired backward graph.
    Every context of the method shares them (today the `EmptyMethodContext` twin analyzer does this);
  * per method: the forward forms of the interpreter that do not read the context of a method key, with their
    reversals (§4.9): the statement summaries and the exit rules (the entry marks of the exit rules come from the
    entry-point sources, which read no context);
  * per METHOD KEY (with its context): the forward forms that read the context, with their reversals: the call plans
    (the callees: the resolver reads the type constraints of the context, `interpreter.md` §3.6) and the entry rules
    (the start filter by the context type, `interpreter.md` §4.3). So a second context of a method never takes the
    callees or the start filter of the first one (`ap-impl.md` DD11);
* the RUN part, made by the run: the rule context bound to the run (the `VulnerabilityStore`, the conjunction store,
  the run mode).

Runs are sequential, so in each run the runner of the method is the only user of its cache entry. This removes the
double construction of the context that `saloed/backward-main` has.

### 4.9 The interpreter interface and the reversal

The interpreter (`interpreter.md`) gives the FORWARD semantics only. The core calls it only through this interface,
and the core makes every backward form by a reversal. The core owns the order of the actions; the interpreter gives
the micro edges and the rules.

```kotlin
interface Interpreter {
    /** §4.4: the forward entry statement, and the forward exits (normal and exceptional). A method key is never an
     *  empty method (§4.4), so a method key always has its entry statement. */

    fun exitNodes(method: MethodKey): List<ExitNode>
    /** interpreter.md §4.3 and §4.7: the entry rules (they read the context: cached per method key, §4.8) and the exit

 *  conditional or conjunctive, and an end-fact action; a must); a pass rule with an `[any]` target keeps `[any]` (a
 *  may); a pass rule with an `AnyField` position on its premise side is a rule error (ap.md S15, W6; interpreter.md

What the core uses in each direction:

| Place | Forward | Backward |
|---|---|---|
| start nodes | `entryNode` | `exitNodes` (the zero fact at every one; another fact at the normal ones) |
| start rules | `entryRules` | `exitRules(…).reversed()` and the sink seeds of the exit sinks |
| a non-call statement | `statementSummary` | `statementSummary(…).reversed()` |
| a call | `callPlan` | `callPlan(…).reversed()` |
| end nodes | the normal `exitNodes` | `entryNode` |
| end rules | `exitRules` | `entryRules(…).reversed()` |

A reversal of a statement summary is `Reverse.Stmt.rev` of the Lean model; the reversal of the bindings is
`Reverse.Call.rev`. The core caches the forward forms and their reversals in the `MethodContextCache` (§4.8): per
(method, statement) for a statement summary and the exit rules; per (method key, statement) for a call plan; per method
key for the entry rules. The
AP operations of `ap.md` §4 apply the micro edges; the interpreter never applies them. `PathFact`, `Pattern` and
`PathEdge` are the types of `ap.md` §3.4 and §4.1. `SinkRule`, `ConjunctiveEdge`, `TypeFilter` and `Cleaner` (above)
are the short forms of the sink of `ap.md` §4.9, the conjunctive edge of §4.6, the type filter of §4.8 and the cleaner
of §4.7.

THE APPLICATION MODES. The core applies a `StatementSummary` in one of three modes. The place of the form gives the
mode, not a field of the form:

| Mode | Forms | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| STATEMENT | a statement summary (`statementSummary`), the rule summary of a method boundary (`RuleStatement.summary`, with the touched bases and keep edges of §4.4 THE BOUNDARY RULE STATEMENTS), the kill on `S` (`CleanStep.Kill.keepEdges`), the read and write of a field cleaner (`CleanStep.Field`) | `interpreter.md` §2.1 steps 2 to 5: a fact on an untouched base passes; a fact on a touched base keeps only what an edge gives |
| STAGE | the summary of a call stage (`CallStage.Edges.summary`) | only the edges give results. The touched bases of the plan (`CallPlan.touched`) do the pass-over (§4.5). A stage summary has every base of its edges in its touched set, so its reversal adds no identity edge (the reversed plan has the PASS_OVER stage of the alias bases instead, §4.5) |
| GEN | the end-fact edges at the method boundaries (`RuleStatement.endFacts`, the `SinkRule.endFacts` of an entry or exit sink) | the input stays where it is; the edges add results (`interpreter.md` §4.1 END FACTS, §4.7 step 2). An end-fact edge reads the zero fact: on a trigger of its sink, it applies to the zero fact in the layer of the sink edge or of the combination (§4.5 THE END-FACT STAGE). Reversed, it applies to every requirement and fires the sink seeds of its sink (§4.5 THE TRIGGER OF AN END FACT). At a call the end facts are the end-fact `Edges` stage (`END_FACTS`, STAGE mode, on the zero fact, on a trigger, §4.5), whose reversal adds no identity |

THE STATIC EXCEPTION. In run 1 the static exception of `ap.md` §4.10 item 1 acts on the statement micro edges: the
statement summaries, the edges of the sources and the unresolved stages of a call (`StageKind.SOURCES`, `UNRESOLVED`),
the kill on `S`, the read and write of a field cleaner (F74), and the boundary rule statements.
At a call it is tested on the caller edge. It acts on no other stage.

## 5. The communication pipeline

### 5.1 Events and channels

Each runner has one channel and one local priority queue, as today. The events:

| Event | Goes to the channel of | Handler | `ap.md` | From today |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Start(root)` | the runner of `root` (sent by the driver) | `addRootZero` | §6.1 | the `MethodWithContext` start event |
| `LinkIn(callee, link)` | the runner of `callee` | `addLink` | E1, E2 | `ExternalInputFact.InputFact` |
| `ZeroIn(callee)` | the runner of `callee` (backward) | `addZeroEntry` | §9.2 `zin` | `ExternalInputFact.InputZero` |
| `RequestIn(method, premise, request)` | the runner of `method` (the caller; run 1) | `addRequest` | E5, E7 | replaces the side-effect channels |
| `Delivery(callee, publications)` | the SUBSCRIBED runner; the publisher's thread sends it | `SubscriptionManager.onDelivery` | E4 | `NewSummaryEdgeEvent` |
| `Work(analyzer)` | the runner of the analyzer (its local queue) | `step` | | the `MethodAnalyzer` event |

Removed:

* the side-effect requirements and summaries, and the mark-unfold requests (`TaintMarkFieldUnfoldRequest`): the
  requests of run 1 replace them (§4.6);
* the delayed-analysis events (`MethodAnalysisDelayed`, `DelayedAnalysisResume`): the field limit replaces them;
* `LambdaResolvedEvent`: the prescan resolves every lambda before run 1 (§9). The call plan reads the lambdas from the
  context cache.

Rules:

* E-1. A handler sends events only through the channels, or by the direct calls that §6.1 permits.
* E-2. Every link carries its caller reference `(caller method key, caller premise key, caller layer, call statement)`.
  The callee needs it to climb a request (§4.6) and to compute the support (§7.5).
* E-3. Duplicates are permitted. `links.add`, `requests.add`, `initials.add` and the subscription insert drop only an
  equal item. `edges.add` also drops a conclusion that a stored conclusion subsumes (`ap.md` §8.1).

### 5.2 The storage with subscription (callee side)

One `SummaryStorage` per method key of the run (O2). It keeps the publications in a path trie keyed by
`base :: premise path`, one entry per member of a premise set, and the list of the subscribed runners. An entry keeps
the tail of its member and the exclusion of an `[any-taint]` member: an `[any-taint]` premise and an `[any]` premise at
one path are two entries (§4.1).

```kotlin
class SummaryStorage(val method: MethodKey) {
    private val lock = Any()
    private val published = PublicationIndex()                  // path trie, ap.md §8; delta on insert (T4)
    private val subscribers = ConcurrentLinkedQueue<SubscriptionManager>()

    /** Only the runner of `method` calls it. P2: insert, then notify. */
    fun publish(pubs: List<Publication>) {
        val delta = synchronized(lock) { published.addAll(pubs) }            // the new part only
        if (delta.isEmpty()) return
        for (s in subscribers) s.notify(method, delta)                         // one Delivery per runner
    }

    fun addSubscriber(s: SubscriptionManager) { subscribers.add(s) }

    /** P3: a linearizable read. The candidates for the added fact `a`; complete for `matches` (§5.3). */
    fun candidates(a: Pattern, config: RunConfig): List<Publication> =
        synchronized(lock) { published.candidates(a, config) }
}
```

P3 asks for the lock on the read (Appendix A gives the defect of today). An implementation may replace the lock by an
immutable snapshot that the writer publishes with a volatile write.

### 5.3 The subscription manager (caller side)

One `SubscriptionManager` per runner. Per callee, it keeps the subscriptions of the unit in a path trie keyed by
`base :: added fact path` (`ap.md` §8.4).

```kotlin
class SubscriptionManager(private val runner: UnitRunner, private val config: RunConfig) {
    private val byCallee = HashMap<MethodKey, CalleeSubscriptions>()       // runner-local (O3)

    /** §4.5 SUBSCRIBE. */
    fun subscribe(sub: Subscription) {
        val storage = runner.summaryStorage(sub.callee)                    // O2: any unit
        val entry = byCallee.getOrPut(sub.callee) {
            CalleeSubscriptions().also { storage.addSubscriber(this) }       // P1: register the handler first
        }
        if (!entry.add(sub)) return                                          // an equal subscription: no replay
        val analyzer = runner.analyzer(sub.caller)
        for (pub in storage.candidates(sub.addedFact, config))               // P1: read after the registration; P3
            if (matches(sub, pub, config)) analyzer.applySummary(sub, pub)   // P4
        if (sub.zeroOnly) return
        val a = sub.addedFact
        for (rec in config.records.byEntry(sub.callee, a))                   // records: read-only (A4); `around`
            if (rec.direction == config.direction && recordApplies(rec.premise.toPattern(), a))
                analyzer.applyRecord(sub, rec)
        for (rec in config.records.byExit(sub.callee, a))                    // the other direction (ap.md §8.7 R3)
            if (rec.direction != config.direction)
                for (rev in rec.reversedAt(a))                               // one reversal per leaf that byExit returns
                    if (recordApplies(rev.premise.toPattern(), a)) analyzer.applyRecord(sub, rev)
    }

    /** The notification of a callee storage: one Delivery event to the channel of this runner. */
    fun notify(callee: MethodKey, pubs: List<Publication>) = runner.send(Delivery(callee, pubs))

    /** The handler of a Delivery. P6: match against the subscriptions NOW. */
    fun onDelivery(callee: MethodKey, pubs: List<Publication>) {
        val entry = byCallee[callee] ?: return
        for (pub in pubs)
            for (sub in entry.candidates(pub, config))                       // complete for `matches`
                if (matches(sub, pub, config)) runner.analyzer(sub.caller).applySummary(sub, pub)  // P4
    }
}

/** P4: the ONE match function of the replay and of the delivery (ap.md §4.3). */
fun matches(sub: Subscription, pub: Publication, config: RunConfig): Boolean {
    val premise = pub.premise                                                // PremiseKey, ap.md §7.1
    if (sub.zeroOnly) return premise.isZero                                  // backward rule zret: no test
    return (0 until premise.size).any { k ->                                 // one member; several members: §5.4
        satisfies(premise.member(k).toPattern(), sub.addedFact, config.restricted)   // ap.md §6.3 `satisfies`:
        // restricted: inside; for a FLOW premise (the mark *) also applicable (F72 R3)
    }
}

/** ap.md §8.7 R4, Lean `DR.retRec`: a record applies by `applicable` or by `inside`. A record with an `[any-taint]`
 *  premise that only `applicable` accepts gives its results in the demand layer (§4.2 `applyRecord`; Lean
 *  `AnyTaintEx.DRX.retRec` with `recLayerX`). In a restricted run `inside` reads the exclusions of both sides
 *  (ap.md §4.3; Lean `AnyTaintEx.satX`). */
fun recordApplies(p: Pattern, a: Pattern): Boolean = applicable(p, a) || inside(p, a)
```

`byEntry` and `byExit` use the lookup `around` (`ap.md` §8.7 R2). `rec.reversedAt(a)` gives the reversal (`ap.md`
§9.1) of each mark-reversible conclusion leaf of `rec` that `byExit` returns for `a`: R3 reverses a record LEAF BY
LEAF (`ap.md` §8.7 R3; the `byExit` index keys each leaf path). Two kinds of leaf have no reversal, and `reversedAt`
gives nothing for them:

* every leaf of a record with an `[any-taint]` premise (a must record): it is END-EXACT only, so its reversal has a
  pair that is not a converse flow, and it is not an exact backward record (Lean `AnyTaintExact.CexRev.cex_rev`);
* an `[any-taint]/E` leaf with `E ≠ {}`: its reversal would need an `[any]` premise with an exclusion, and the
  backward run has none (`ap.md` W8).

Other permitted leaves reverse by AP §9.1. Exact reversal requires the
empty-premise-exclusion and mark-reversibility conditions stated there. A canonical
FLOW premise has empty field exclusion under AP §6.1's hand-off/record guards.
The current base exactness and shape proofs are in [proof-status.md](proof-status.md);
full X-record/pipeline integration remains open. An arbitrary nonempty-star
premise is not justified by the canonical theorem.

The reversal of an `[any-taint]` leaf with the empty exclusion (a leaf `$ → [any-taint]`) has the premise `[any]` in
the backward run (`ap.md` §9.1). It applies only to an `[any]` requirement, which is in the demand layer (W6), so its
results are in the demand layer. It gives no normal backward edge: a reuse limit (§11).

A must-premise needs every location of it, so a summary of an `[any-taint]` premise applies only to an added fact that
the premise lies INSIDE, with the exclusions of both (`ap.md` §4.3; Lean `AnyTaintEx.SatInsideX`: the exactness needs
it, `satX` has it, `AnyTaintEx.satX_inside`). An `[any-taint]` premise occurs only in a forward restricted run, and
there `matches` is `inside`; so `matches` needs no other test. A FLOW PREMISE (the mark `*`, a restricted run since
F72) is satisfied by `inside` or by `applicable` (`ap.md` §4.3; F72 R3; Lean: `Abs.satW` in the base model; the X-tail extension is pending): it passes the mark
of the added fact, as the policy premise of run 1 and a `*`-premise record do. `satisfies` reads the mark of the
premise, so `matches` needs no other test. A concrete premise is satisfied by `inside` only. A normal edge of a
must-premise is END-EXACT: every
admitted location of its conclusion gets its value from some admitted location of the premise. It is not exact pair
by pair (`AnyTaintEx.EndExactX`; `AnyTaintExact.CexApp.record_not_pair_exact`).

The index queries (`ap.md` §8; keys `base :: path`):

| Test | Replay (publications for a new `a`) | Delivery (subscriptions for a new `j`) |
|---|---|---|
| run 1, `applicable(j, a)`: `a` at or below `j` | `lookupPrefixes(a.base :: a.path)` | `lookupExtensions(j.base :: j.path)` |
| restricted, `inside(j, a)`: `j` at or below `a` | `lookupExtensions(a.base :: a.path)` | `lookupPrefixes(j.base :: j.path)` |
| restricted, a FLOW premise `j` (F72): `inside(j, a)` or `applicable(j, a)` | both lookups of the two rows above, on the publications of FLOW premises | both lookups of the two rows above, for a new FLOW premise `j` |
| a record, `applicable` or `inside` | `around(a.base :: a.path)` on `byEntry`, and on `byExit` with the reversed premise as the key | (records are read-only) |

Each lookup returns every entry that its exact test accepts (`PipelineStore.replay_run1`, `deliver_run1`,
`replay_restricted`, `deliver_restricted`, `record_lookup`). For a FLOW premise the union of the two candidate sets
contains every entry that `inside` or `applicable` accepts. Both paths then call `matches`.

The subscription insert deduplicates exactly. It never drops a subscription that a stored subscription subsumes.
Reason: the run-1 test is not monotone in the added fact (a fact above `j` does not satisfy `j`). So a subsumed
subscription can match a publication that the stored one does not match. The same holds for the links.

THE PROTOCOL CONDITIONS. The model step `Step` (§5.5) builds in P1 to P6, A3 and the exact part of E-3 (the
subsumption part is `Pipeline.StepD`, §5.5). P1 to P4 are necessary: each has a counterexample in
`PipelineProofs.lean`, a reachable quiescent state that misses an object of the closure.

| # | Condition | Today | In the model |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | REGISTER BEFORE READ: the subscriber registers its handler on the storage before the replay read. | yes (the first `getOrPut` registers) | `proc`; counterexample `PCex.cex_P1` |
| P2 | INSERT BEFORE NOTIFY: the publisher inserts the publication before it reads the handler list. | yes (`addEdges`) | `proc`, `notify`; counterexample `PCex.cex_P2` |
| P3 | LINEARIZABLE READ: the replay read sees every publication whose insert came before it (A2). | not formally (no lock on the read) | `replay`; counterexample `PCex.cex_P3` |
| P4 | ONE MATCH FUNCTION: the replay and the delivery use the same exact test on complete candidate sets. | no (Appendix A) | `replay`, `deliver` both use `join`; counterexample `PCex.cex_P4` |
| P5 | NO REMOVAL: a handler, a subscription and a stored publication stay until the run ends. | yes (`cleanup` runs after the run) | built in: no step removes them |
| P6 | MATCH AT DELIVERY: a delivery matches against the subscriptions of the runner when the runner handles it. | yes (`processMethodSummary`) | `deliver`. The no-loss theorem would also hold with a match at notification time. The code needs P6 because the subscriptions are local to their runner (O3). |

### 5.4 Summaries with several premises (E6)

A publication `{j1, …, jk} → g` (`ap.md` §4.6) reaches the caller by the replay or the delivery like every other
publication. The caller combines it in its conjunction store (`ap.md` §8.9):

* Key: (callee, premise key, layer of the publication, call statement). Value: the merged conclusion that has arrived
  so far, and per premise index `m` the subscriptions at that call statement whose added fact satisfies `jm`.
* A subscription goes under EVERY index that it satisfies. No member is the zero fact (`ap.md` §4.6: a conjunction
  drops the zero fact), so the zero subscription never takes part (`PipelineNDZ.clDNz_ndpub_no_zero`,
  `clDNz_ndpub_zero_sub`; run 1; a restricted run is argued, `ap.md` §11.2). The backward run has no summary with several
  premises: it reverses a conjunction into one micro edge per literal, with every result in the demand layer
  (`ap.md` §9.1, §9.2; §4.3 THE REVERSAL OF A CONJUNCTION).
* A new subscription under an index: combine it with the stored subscriptions of the other indexes (one per index,
  every combination), and apply the stored conclusion to each full combination.
* A new conclusion delta: apply it to every full combination.

The key does not contain the conclusion. So a combination meets every delta of the conclusion, in any order of the
replays and the deliveries. Both sides of this join are in the caller.

### 5.5 The no-loss theorem

The protocol requires: at quiescence, every satisfying processed
(subscription, publication) pair has its application processed, and every enabled
local rule has fired. Replay and notification can race; their union must cover
every pair. Exact duplicate suppression can process a pair once.

The constructive generic protocol proof and its encoding conditions are in
[proof-status.md](proof-status.md). The current F72/F75 pipeline instance remains
open; generic protocol completeness alone does not prove AP closure coverage.

## 6. Scheduling and the end of a run

### 6.1 The runner loop

The loop of today stays: an unlimited channel, a local priority queue, a quantum of `RUNNER_STEPS_QUANT` steps per
`Work` event, and the priority of the analyzers with zero-fact work. Changes:

* The events of §5.1 replace the old events.
* Two direct calls are permitted, as today:
  1. the analyzer calls `subscribe` of its own `SubscriptionManager`. The replay then calls `applySummary` and
     `applyRecord` of the SAME analyzer. These only add to its edge store and its worklist;
  2. the analyzer calls `addLink` of a callee in the same unit (§4.5). `addLink` only changes the stores of the callee
     and sends events. A recursive call calls `addLink` of the same analyzer, which is permitted for the same reason.

  Every other interaction between two analyzers is an event.
* The priority keys must not change while the event is in the queue. Today `EventComparator` reads `analyzerSteps` and
  the zero-work flag, which change. This breaks the heap order but loses no event.

The runner interface that the analyzer uses:

```kotlin
interface RunnerPort {
    val config: RunConfig
    val interpreter: Interpreter
    val contexts: MethodContextCache
    val vulnerabilities: VulnerabilityStore
    /** Q1: count, then put into the channel of the target runner (§5.1: by `callee`, `method`, or THIS runner for
     *  a Delivery, which the publisher's thread sends through the subscriber's `notify`). */
    fun send(event: RunEvent)
    fun enqueue(analyzer: RunMethodAnalyzer)               // W1: a Work event if the analyzer is not queued
    fun analyzer(key: MethodKey): RunMethodAnalyzer        // this unit only; made on demand
    fun subscribe(sub: Subscription)                       // the SubscriptionManager of this runner
    fun summaryStorage(key: MethodKey): SummaryStorage     // RunManager.summaryStorage: any unit (O2)
    fun link(callee: MethodKey, link: Link)                // same unit: a direct addLink; else LinkIn
}
```

### 6.2 The in-flight counter

The counter protocol of today stays, with one counter object per run:

* Q1. Increment before send: the counter goes up before the event goes into a channel or a local queue.
* Q2. Decrement after the handler: the counter goes down after the handler ends, after all its sends.
* Q3. A guard during the start: the run counts one phantom event while it sends the `Start` events.
* Q4. One counter per run: an event of an old run cannot change the counter of a new run.

Local work is inside an event:

* W1. An action that adds a worklist item or a pending publication to an analyzer with `queued = false` sets `queued`
  and sends `Work` (counted by Q1). This includes the direct `addLink`, the replay's `applySummary` and a request
  answer.
* W2. When the quantum ends and work is left, the runner puts the analyzer back into its local queue. The `Work`
  event stays counted.
* W3. The `Work` event ends (Q2) only when the worklist is empty and the pending publications are in the storage. Then
  `queued = false`.

THEOREM (`Pipeline.Quiesce.creach_inv`, `cnt_zero_iff`, `done_iff`, `done_final`). With Q1 to Q3, the counter equals
the number of events in the channels and the local queues plus the number of running handlers. So it is zero exactly
when no event waits and no handler runs, and after that no step is possible. `Pipeline.Quiesce.bad_early_done`: if the
counter goes down when the handler STARTS (not Q2), the run can end while an event is still pending. With W1 to W3,
zero means quiescence (argued, §11).

### 6.3 Abnormal end

* A timeout, the memory guard (`MemoryManager`) or an exception makes the run INCOMPLETE. The `RunManager` returns
  the status: `COMPLETE`, `TIMEOUT`, `OOM` or `FAILED`.
* AN EXCEPTION IS EVERY `Throwable`, an `Error` too (for example a JVM `OutOfMemoryError` or a `StackOverflowError`).
  In a runner, in the code of a run on the caller thread, or at the barrier (§7.1), it gives `FAILED` (phase 3:
  `EXCEPTION`, §9), and the driver returns the report so far. A JVM `OutOfMemoryError` does not give `OOM`: the status
  `OOM` comes only from a memory guard, the guard of a run or the guard of the barrier (§7.2 B4) (`ap-history.md` F68).
* THE FIRST END WINS. The status of a run is set once, by a compare-and-set. The quiescence sets `COMPLETE` in the
  same way. So a late end (the memory guard or the timeout while the `RunManager` joins the runners) does not turn a
  complete run into an incomplete one. One exception: the join overrides the first end. A runner that does not stop
  makes the run `FAILED`, also after the quiescence, because its stores can still change.
* EVERY CANCELLATION HAS A KNOWN CAUSE. The status is set before every cancel, so every cancel has a known cause: the
  timeout, a memory guard (of a run or of the barrier), or a runner failure. Three ends of a run cancel the analysis:
  the timeout of the run (`TIMEOUT`), the memory guard of the run (`OOM`) and a runner exception (`FAILED`). Each one
  is `RunManager.fail(status)`: it first sets the status of the run by the compare-and-set, then cancels the
  `Cancellation` and completes the run. After the quiescence or an earlier end, `fail` does nothing (the first end
  wins). So a runner exception ends the run at once, with no wait for the timeout, and the other runners stop at their
  next checkpoint. After a cancel, a handler can throw `Cancellation.Cancelled` (a checkpoint of the `ApManager` or of
  the alias analysis). The runner loop catches it and only stops: the run keeps the status of its cause. So the status
  always gives the real reason, and there is no `CANCELLED` status and no external cancel. The `RunManager` activates
  its `Cancellation` when it is made (in its constructor), before a runner starts, so a cancel is never undone by a
  later activation. The guard of the barrier also cancels, with the status `OOM` of the iteration; no runner is alive
  then (§7.2 B4).
* A throw in the code of a run on the caller thread (for example the routing of the `Start` events or the wait for the
  end) is `fail(FAILED)`: the `RunManager` still joins its runners and returns `FAILED`.
* The hand-off of an incomplete run is not complete. The theorems of `ap.md` §6.6 do not apply to the runs after it,
  so the driver does not start a run after an incomplete run (§7.1). The incomplete run adds nothing to the report
  (§7.5).
* Each run has its own coroutine scope with a `SupervisorJob`. The exception of one runner does not cancel the scope
  of a later run. (Today one failed runner cancels `analyzerScope` for every later run.)
* The `RunManager` joins every runner coroutine before it returns, on every exit, also when its own code throws. If a
  runner does not stop, the run ends as `FAILED` (the driver reads none of its stores), the analysis stops, and no
  later run starts. (Today a runner that does not stop in `cancellationTimeout` stays and can change the next run.)
* A cancellation must also complete the run. Today every `cancel()` of the analysis comes with its status
  (`updateFailureStatus(TIMEOUT)` or `(OOM)`) and with `analysisCompletion.complete`; keep the three calls together
  (`RunManager.fail`).

* The run sequence is `ap.md` §6.6: run 1 (forward), run 2 (backward), run 3 (forward), and so on.
* THE STOP RULES (`ap-history.md` F70). After a complete forward run, the barrier applies these rules, in this order:
  1. `STOP_RULE`: after the run the report has NO DEMAND VULNERABILITY (§1): every vulnerability that the run reports
     is CONFIRMED, by this run or by an earlier complete forward run (`ReportBuilder.hasDemandVulnerability`, §10).
     Then the hand-off gives no sink seed (§7.3), so the next backward run has no requirement except the zero fact.
     The CONFIRMED part of the report is final (a CONFIRMED state never changes, §7.5), and every real vulnerability
     is CONFIRMED in it. Reason: each forward run reports every real vulnerability that no earlier complete forward
     run confirmed (§7.7, `HandoffMain.iteration_generalN`; for the driver
     `PipelineHandoffDriverExt.driver_iterationNX_demand`, finite `driver_iterationNX_upto`), and this run reports only
     CONFIRMED ones. That every later forward run only
     repeats the zero fact and the records is ARGUED (`HandoffExclusion.zinv_all` with no seed in any method, then
     `HandoffExclusion.exclusion_demand` per method; the composition is not stated, §7.1 `STOP_RULE`);
  2. `NO_DEMAND_EDGE` (the user's rule, `task.md`): the run has NO DEMAND-LAYER OBJECT: no demand-layer edge delta,
     no demand-layer summary delta and no DEMAND LINK (a link whose added fact is in the demand layer, `ap.md` §8.3)
     (`RunResult.demandLayerEdges == 0`, the `counters` of §4.1). Then every sink witness and every link of the run is
     normal, so each sink witness satisfies conditions 1 and 2 of `ap.md` §4.9 and the condition on the layer of the
     link, and a DEMAND entry fails only the JOINT support of a premise set with several members (a conjunction,
     `ap.md` §4.6): no one call supplies all its members. That a later forward run cannot supply them at one call
     either is ARGUED, not proved, and it is an open question (§7.1 `NO_DEMAND_EDGE`). The stop keeps
     every real vulnerability in the report (§7.5 THE OUTPUT);
  3. `POLICY`: `continueAfter(config, result, frontiers)` gave false (a practical stop strategy that reads the
     frontier log, §7.8; out of scope).

  At every stop after a complete forward run, the report holds every real vulnerability, CONFIRMED or DEMAND (§7.5
  THE OUTPUT; for the driver `PipelineHandoffDriverExt.driver_iterationNX_upto`, with `C` = confirmed by a complete
  forward run up to `k`). The three rules differ only in what a later run can still change: after `STOP_RULE` every
  real vulnerability is CONFIRMED already; after `NO_DEMAND_EDGE` a later run confirms no more (argued, an open
  question); after `POLICY` a later run can confirm more or refute a DEMAND entry.
* The driver applies the stop rules and asks `continueAfter` only after a complete FORWARD run. A complete backward run
  always goes on to the next forward run: its only output is the hand-off of that run (§7.4). So the iteration always
  ends after a forward run, or at an abnormal end (§7.7).
* The driver checks the field limit of each run: run 1 has at least 1 (`ap.md` S12 (d)), and the limit does not
  decrease (`ap.md` W3). A policy that breaks either is an error: the `require` fails, and the iteration ends as at a
  throw in the guarded region (`FAILED`; for run 1 the report has no entry).
* THE BUDGET. The analysis has ONE budget (`budget`, a parameter of the driver, §0). THE TIMEOUT OF A RUN is
  `policy.timeout(config, remaining)`, where `remaining` is the budget minus the time so far: by default each run gets
  the whole rest of the budget. The `RunManager` gets it in `run(timeout)`. A run that its timeout ends is incomplete
  (§6.3), and the analysis ends with the report of the earlier complete forward runs (§7.5).
* THE FRONTIER LOG. After EVERY complete run (forward and backward, also the last one), the barrier computes the
  hand-off and logs the frontier of the run (§7.8). The stop rules do not read the frontier. `continueAfter` gets the
  frontiers of every complete run so far.
* THE END OF THE ANALYSIS is an output: `Report.end = AnalysisEnd(status, run, direction, reason)` (§10). `run` and
  `direction` are those of the last run. The reasons:
  * `STOP_RULE`: a complete forward run with no DEMAND vulnerability; `status` is `COMPLETE`;
  * `NO_DEMAND_EDGE`: a complete forward run with a DEMAND vulnerability and no demand-layer object (edge delta,
    summary delta, link); `status` is `COMPLETE`;
  * `POLICY`: `continueAfter` gave false after a complete forward run; `status` is `COMPLETE`;
  * `ABNORMAL`: an incomplete run (`status` is its status: `TIMEOUT`, `OOM` or `FAILED`), a throw in the guarded
    region of the driver (`status` is `FAILED`), or a hit of the memory guard of the barrier (`status` is `OOM`).
* ONE GUARDED REGION. The whole loop body of the driver is one guarded region (`catch (e: Throwable)`): the
  `RunConfig` of run 1 and its check, `RunManager(...)`, `run(...)` and the barrier (the confirmation, `persist`, the
  hand-off, the frontier log). A throw there, an `Error` too (§6.3), ends the iteration with `FAILED`. The driver
  returns the report so far: the results of the earlier runs stay (`ap-history.md` F67, F68). The `RunManager` joins
  its runners on every exit (§6.3), so no runner of the run runs when the driver returns.
* THE MEMORY GUARD OF THE BARRIER (§7.2 B4). A hit at the barrier ends the iteration with `AnalysisEnd(OOM, run,
  direction, ABNORMAL)` and the report so far. The barrier has no deadline (§11).

### 7.2 The barrier

* B1. The driver computes the hand-off only after the run is complete and no runner of the run is alive (§6.3).
* B2. The next run starts only after the hand-off is complete.
* B3. The driver may read the stores of the finished run in parallel, read-only.
* B4. The barrier runs under its own memory guard (`MemoryManager`), as today's confirmation: the threshold of today
  (`TRACE_GENERATION_MEMORY_THRESHOLD = 0.99`) and the same mechanism (`TaintAnalysisUnitRunnerManager.kt:374-384`,
  `:645`). The soft-reference managers stay enabled during the barrier, so `persist` interns with live tables and the
  persisted records share nodes. A hit cancels the `Cancellation`; the loops of the barrier (the support, `persist`,
  the hand-off, the frontier) call `Cancellation.checkpoint` once per analyzer, so the barrier stops at its next
  checkpoint. The
  iteration then ends with `AnalysisEnd(OOM, run, direction, ABNORMAL)` and the report so far (§7.1). The driver also
  checks the `Cancellation` after the barrier, so a hit after the last checkpoint is not lost (the next `RunManager`
  would activate the `Cancellation` again). The barrier has no deadline (§11).

With B1, the hand-off reads the closure of the run (`PipelineDriver.result_D`, `result_DR`, `result_DB`; with the
tail `[any-taint]` `PipelineAnyTaintEx.result_D6X`, `result_DRX`): the demand edges that the run stored are its
publications of the non-crossable leaves (§4.6). So the hand-off is exactly the hand-off of `ap.md` §9.2 (Lean
`Handoff.handF`, `demOfN`; `PipelineHandoffDriver.driver_iterationNX` reads them from the final states, §7.7).

### 7.3 Forward run `n` to backward run `n + 1`

At the barrier, build an immutable demand store from each method's stored demand
pieces. Apply AP §9.2's forward-to-backward construction and normalization; do
not re-test crossability on a reduced piece. The store owns the complete entry and
exit patterns and their base/path indexes (AP §8.6).

Build `SeedIndex` from all witnesses of the report's DEMAND keys after run `n`.
Confirmed keys add no hand-off sink seed. The interpreter forms supply each
alternative's patterns. The backward engine can add the end-fact trigger seeds
defined in AP §9.2 during the run. Retain raw normal single-premise records and
make their permitted leaf reversals available (AP §8.7). A normal non-crossable leaf
can be both a same-direction record and a source of demand pieces.

### 7.4 Backward run `n + 1` to forward run `n + 2`

Build demand using AP §9.2's three cases: implicit zero demand, zero-premise seed
paths with no exit pattern, and stored publications of non-crossable nonzero raw
leaves. Normalize both pattern marks. Build source `SeedIndex` from `sourceHits`.
The engine does not filter records by source seeds: a recorded call can supply a
source result without replaying its source.

Persist raw normal nonzero single-premise backward summaries (AP §8.7) and expose
their permitted reversal. Every input remains read-only during the next run.
The static base is touched/bound at calls by the interpreter; the driver carries
no separate static input between runs.

### 7.5 Confirmation and the report

After each complete forward run, at its barrier:

1. Compute supported premise sets as the least fixed point of AP §4.9 condition
   3 over the run's links, per method key. Start with each root's `{zero}`. One
   call must supply the whole set through normal caller edges with supported
   premise sets. Read the added tails, marks, and exclusions for must support.
2. Test each sink witness using AP §4.9 conditions 1–3. A conjunctive edge set
   is tested jointly, not member by member. A FLOW premise cannot confirm a sink.
3. Update the vulnerability store and report atomically (AP §8.10).

The support can change until quiescence, so compute it only at this barrier.
No support cache from an incomplete run is used. A key is confirmed if any witness
in any context/alternative is confirmed. Confirmation is final.

The report keeps all previously confirmed keys and every other key reported by
the latest complete forward run as DEMAND. An older unconfirmed key absent from
that run leaves the report. Output every report entry with its simple trace.
No-loss refutation depends on the mode/iteration contract in AP §6.6, whose full
current proof is open; the report mechanics alone do not establish it.

An incomplete forward or backward run adds no evidence and refutes nothing.
Keep the report from earlier complete forward runs and set `Report.end` to the
cause. If run 1 is incomplete, the report and output are empty. A memory-guard
abort is OOM; any `Throwable` is FAILED. Cancellation always has a known cause
set before cancel (§6.3).

### 7.6 What stays after a run

| Data | Stays until | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| the run summary stores of a run (the summaries before the restriction and the stored demand edges, §4.1, §4.6) and the `sourceHits` of a backward run | its hand-off is computed (the end of its barrier) | §7.3, §7.4 (the demand edges, the source hits); `persist` (the summaries, `ap.md` §8.7 R1) |
| the `counters` of every analyzer of a run (§4.1) | its frontier is logged (the end of its barrier) | §7.1 (`NO_DEMAND_EDGE`), §7.8 |
| the frontier of a run (counts and method keys, no edge) | the end of the analysis | §7.8; `continueAfter` |
| the links of a forward run | its confirmation is computed | §7.5 |
| the edge stores, the initial fact stores, and the links of a backward run | the end of the run | — (the barrier never reads them) |
| `SummaryStorage`, `SubscriptionManager`, the runners, the backward analyzers | the end of the run, or its hand-off | — |
| `RecordStore`, `VulnerabilityStore`, `MethodContextCache`, `ApManager` | the end of the analysis | every run |

THE BARRIER READS ONLY: the links of a forward run (the support), the summaries before the restriction (`persist`),
the stored demand edges (the hand-off, §4.6), the `sourceHits` of a backward run (the hand-off), the `counters` (the
stop rule `NO_DEMAND_EDGE`, the frontier), the `VulnerabilityStore` and the report (the confirmation,
the report, the stop rule `STOP_RULE`, the sink seeds of the DEMAND vulnerabilities) and the forms of the
`MethodContextCache` (the seed patterns). So the `RunManager` keeps of a complete run only what the barrier reads: at
the end of the run it drops the edge stores, the initial fact stores and the links of a backward run. Before it drops
an initial fact store, it sets the `counters` that the frontier reads (a non-zero initial fact exists or not). The
barrier holds the stores that it reads under its own memory guard (§7.2 B4). The driver keeps the result of a run
only in the frame of its barrier (`runOnce`, §7.1), so no live slot keeps it during the next run.
Every other object of a run is garbage after the run: the edge stores too. No store of a run stays for a trace resolver
(the trace resolution is out of scope, §9). An incomplete run keeps no store after it ends (§7.5). The engine of a run
is never used again (§2), so no state of one run can leak into the next run. This removes the leaks of today's reuse
(Appendix A).

### 7.7 The driver theorems

The driver must preserve AP §6.6 contract B, retain the AP §8.7 records, and hand
off exactly the data of §§7.3–7.4 after each complete run. It must retain confirmed
entries and discard incomplete-run evidence (§7.5).

The historical concrete-driver theorems and current open obligations are listed
in [proof-status.md](proof-status.md). Current local demand/index/exactness results
do not establish full iteration or confirmation support. Do not claim those
properties from an earlier driver instance.

### 7.8 Localization and the frontier

Demand restricts nonzero analysis; persistent records cross callees with crossable leaves.
Full current method-exclusion and round-to-round narrowing are open (AP §6.6).
Do not infer exact narrowing from a stable count: normalization can enlarge marks
and reduction has representability limits. A method with no demand edge and no
seed in its call subtree is intended to leave nonzero analysis. Zero work still
repeats in every run.

After **every complete run**, including the final one, the barrier logs a
`Frontier` with method keys and counts, not edges. Compute it in one pass over
analyzer counters and the hand-off:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `analysed` | Method keys with nonzero initial facts |
| `demandEdges` | Stored outgoing demand pieces per method key |
| `crossableLeaves` | Crossable raw summary leaves |
| `recordCrossings` | Record applications at calls, including permitted reversed records |
| `demandVulnerabilities`, `confirmedVulnerabilities` | Report states after a forward run |
| `seeds` | Outgoing sink seeds (forward) or source seeds (backward) |
| `zeroOnly`, `zeroOnlyEdges` | Method keys analysed only from zero, and their edge counts |
| `demandByCause` (optional) | Demotions by cut, may target, cleaner, must record, or demand input |

Keep the log until analysis ends. `continueAfter` receives the logs of complete
runs and can use size, progress, timing, and remaining budget. The configured
policy owns that choice. Stop checks run only after complete forward runs; an
incomplete next run would leave the same report. Logging supplies no pruning rule.

## 8. Code reuse

Existing modules and migration background are in
[implementation-background.md](implementation-background.md). The current
implementation plan is [analyzer-impl.md](analyzer-impl.md).

## 9. Interface to the prescan and the output

* PRESCAN (phase 3). The prescan runs the current core. It gives the new core:
  * the reduced rule set (`relevantRuleIds`, the prescan rule ids);
  * the lambda resolutions per call site (the prescan lambdas: the values of the `TrackerWithSubscriber` of each call
    site);
  * the fact type checker and the external method tracker;
  * the root methods.

  The core copies the resolutions into the `MethodContextCache` once, before run 1. It keeps no reference to a context
  of the prescan.
* PRESCAN MEMORY. The caller gathers the prescan info above. Then, before run 1, it releases the WHOLE prescan state:
  the prescan runners, the unit storage, the analyzers, the AP manager of the prescan and `JIRAnalysisManager.contexts`.
  No prescan edge, summary or alias analysis stays alive during the runs (`ap-history.md` F67).
* OUTPUT (phase 3). The core gives the `Report` (§10): the entries, each with its state CONFIRMED or DEMAND (§7.5) and
  the witnesses of its key in the run of that state (the fields of `ap.md` §8.10), and `end`, the end of the analysis
  (`AnalysisEnd`, §7.1). The phase-3 output holds EVERY entry of the report: the CONFIRMED vulnerabilities and the
  DEMAND vulnerabilities of the latest complete forward run, each with the simple trace (TRACE, below; `ap-history.md`
  F68). The method key of an output vulnerability is the method key of a confirmed witness if the entry has one, else
  of the first witness. Phase 3 maps `end` to today's `TaintAnalyzer.Status`. If run 1 is incomplete, the report has no
  entry and the output is empty; the status gives the cause. Today a full scan that times out outputs the
  vulnerabilities that it found before the timeout (`TaintAnalyzer.kt:157-223`): this is a deviation from today (§7.5,
  §11).
* TRACE. The trace resolution is out of scope. The core keeps no store of a run for a trace resolver (§7.6). The
  phase-3 output gives every entry, CONFIRMED and DEMAND, a SIMPLE trace: the trace with only the sink statement (today
  `TracePathGenerationResult.Simple`,
  `core/opentaint-dataflow-core/opentaint-dataflow/src/main/kotlin/org/opentaint/dataflow/ap/ifds/trace/path/TracePath.kt:48-51`).
  Phase 3 logs the count of the entries per state (CONFIRMED, DEMAND).
* NO EXTERNAL CANCEL (phase 3). The phase-3 entry has no `cancel()`: the timeout of a run, a memory guard (of a run or
  of the barrier) and a runner exception are the only causes of a cancellation (§6.3). So phase 3 maps the status one
  to one: `COMPLETE` → `OK`, `TIMEOUT` → `TIMEOUT`, `OOM` → `OOM`, `FAILED` → `EXCEPTION`.
* THE PHASE-3 GUARD. Phase 3 calls the analysis inside `runCatching`, as today (`TaintAnalyzer.kt:157-158`). A throw
  outside the driver (the setup of the analysis) gives an empty output and the status `EXCEPTION`. A throw inside the
  driver never reaches phase 3: the driver returns the report so far (§7.1).

---

## 10. Reference code

[analyzer-impl.md](analyzer-impl.md) gives the current API and algorithm proposal.
The normative event, storage, and ordering contracts are §§2–7 above.
Historical reference code is in
[implementation-background.md](implementation-background.md).

## 11. Limits

[ap.md](ap.md) §11 states the analysis limits and [proof-status.md](proof-status.md)
is the single proof-status list. In particular, current mode coverage, X-tail
integration, confirmation support, localization, and the pipeline/driver instance
remain open. F75 repairs the checked root-EXACT loss; the old root example is not
an unresolved behavior decision.

The runner retains exact subscriptions and links. Tree publications must denote
the union of their path deltas. Every implementation shortcut must preserve the
event joins, raw-summary persistence and crossing tests, barriers, and per-leaf AP operations. A
generic quiescence theorem or historical tree proof is insufficient to establish
these obligations for a different encoding.

Unresolved-call effects, aliases, exceptions, end facts, interpreter rule forms,
and trace resolution have the limits stated in the AP and interpreter specs.
The current base model does not establish these combined effects.

## 12. The formal model

The model, assumptions, checked protocol results, and open current encodings are
listed in [proof-status.md](proof-status.md). Build and audit [lean](lean) there.

## 13. Test plan (TDD)

[validation-plan.md](validation-plan.md) contains the protocol, driver, report,
and interpreter checks. Tests must use current AP semantics and raw-summary
ownership. Historical test results do not prove the current encoding.
