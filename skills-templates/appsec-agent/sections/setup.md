### 1. Confirm the toolchain

Confirm `opentaint` is on PATH with `opentaint -v`. If it's missing, don't proceed silently — tell the user and offer the install command for their platform, run an install only on explicit confirmation:

- macOS / Linux, in order: `brew install --cask seqra/tap/opentaint` · `npm install -g @seqra/opentaint`
- Windows: `npm install -g @seqra/opentaint`

After installing, run `opentaint health` to confirm everything's resolved.

### 2. Confirm agent nesting

Both pipelines require two subagent levels: MAIN → stage orchestrator → leaf. Confirm the harness permits depth 2 before starting; otherwise ask the user to enable it.

These two checks are the only setup steps the pipeline you hand off to may skip.
