# create-dataflow-approximation — Java / JVM

The JVM procedure, keyed to the body's steps.

## Workflow

### 1. Find the method's source

An app-internal method sits in the project's own sources under `<project-root>`. For a library method, the resolved jars are in `.opentaint/project/dependencies` — locate the class with `unzip -l <jar> | grep <class-as-path>` (dotted class name with `.` → `/`) and decompile it for readable source, or disassemble it with `javap -c -p -classpath <jar> <fully.qualified.ClassName>` when no decompiler is available.

### 2. Write the approximation source

Create Java files under `.opentaint/dataflow/<batch>` — one `@Approximate` class per target class. `@Approximate(TargetClass.class)` binds a model to exactly that class, so target the EXACT class the analyzer dropped — the dropped FQN reflects how the call resolved: an interface-typed receiver (`Map m = ...; m.computeIfAbsent(...)`) drops `java.util.Map#computeIfAbsent`, a concrete one (`new HashMap<>()`) drops `java.util.HashMap#computeIfAbsent`. Reach the real object with `(TargetClass) (Object) this`, put functional-interface parameters behind `@ArgumentTypeContext`, and branch with `OpentaintNdUtil.nextBool()` so the analyzer walks both paths. Never leave a body empty.

```java
package com.example.approximations.batchpkg;   // per-batch package (e.g. ...approximations.cn_hutool_001) — see the globally-unique rule below

import org.opentaint.ir.approximation.annotation.Approximate;
import org.opentaint.jvm.dataflow.approximations.ArgumentTypeContext;
import org.opentaint.jvm.dataflow.approximations.OpentaintNdUtil;

import java.util.function.Function;

@Approximate(com.example.lib.ReactiveProcessor.class)
public class ReactiveProcessor {

    // Model: taint on this flows through the function to the result
    public Object transform(@ArgumentTypeContext Function fn) throws Throwable {
        com.example.lib.ReactiveProcessor self =
            (com.example.lib.ReactiveProcessor) (Object) this;
        if (OpentaintNdUtil.nextBool()) return null;
        Object input = self.getValue();
        return fn.apply(input);
    }

    // Model: taint on this flows to the consumer argument
    public void subscribe(@ArgumentTypeContext java.util.function.Consumer consumer) {
        com.example.lib.ReactiveProcessor self =
            (com.example.lib.ReactiveProcessor) (Object) this;
        if (OpentaintNdUtil.nextBool()) {
            consumer.accept(self.getValue());
        }
    }
}
```

Wrapper-returning operators (a `Mono`/`Flux`, `Optional`, `Stream`, a builder — anything where the taint stays inside a container): declare the real concrete return type, not `Object`; in the `nextBool()` branch `return self`, not `null`; and extract → apply → re-wrap so a downstream extractor (`block`, `get`, …) can pull the tainted value back out:

```java
@Approximate(reactor.core.publisher.Mono.class)
public class Mono {
    public reactor.core.publisher.Mono map(@ArgumentTypeContext Function fn) throws Throwable {
        reactor.core.publisher.Mono self = (reactor.core.publisher.Mono) (Object) this;
        if (OpentaintNdUtil.nextBool()) return self;
        Object up = self.block();                                  // extract upstream element
        return reactor.core.publisher.Mono.justOrEmpty(fn.apply(up)); // apply mapper, re-wrap
    }
}
```

### 3. Test against the test project

Run `test approximation run` over the compiled test project applying this batch's sources, iterate the sources until the samples pass:

```bash
opentaint test approximation run .opentaint/test-compiled/<batch> \
  -o .opentaint/test-results/<batch> \
  --dataflow-approximations .opentaint/dataflow/<batch>
```

`test approximation run` applies its own bundled fixed source→sink rule automatically — you don't author or pass one. The CLI auto-compiles the `.java` sources against the analyzer JAR (for `@Approximate`, `OpentaintNdUtil`, `ArgumentTypeContext`) and the project's dependencies; if compilation fails it reports the errors and aborts before the tests. A positive sample is a `falseNegative` until the model propagates taint. Read the result with the bundled script — it prints the pass/fail counts and names each failing sample, so you don't parse the JSON by hand:

```bash
uv run scripts/check-test-result.py <batch>
```

Fix by the verdict it reports:

- still `falseNegative` → the `@Approximate(...)` target class or a method signature doesn't match what the analyzer sees, or the body doesn't route taint from the real source to the modeled result/argument; diagnose the mismatch, don't rationalize a non-result. Most common: target-class mismatch with the dropped FQN — re-target the exact dropped class and match the cast (`(java.util.HashMap) (Object) this`)
- `falsePositive` (a negative sample fired) → the model is over-broad: it taints a read it shouldn't, e.g. a field it wasn't stored under. Narrow the propagation until the negative stays non-firing while the positive passes

## Key patterns

| Pattern | Usage |
|---|---|
| `@Approximate(TargetClass.class)` | Link the approximation to its target class. Must be on the compile classpath (a project dependency or a JDK type) |
| `(TargetClass) (Object) this` | Cast to reach the real object's methods |
| `@ArgumentTypeContext` | On lambda / functional-interface parameters |
| `OpentaintNdUtil.nextBool()` | Non-deterministic branch — the analyzer considers both paths |

## Constraints

- Java 8 source compatibility
- Put the `@Approximate` classes in a neutral package (e.g. `com.example.approximations`) — never the target library's own package. Inside the library's package every bare FQN resolves to your approximation's non-generic class instead of the real type, breaking compilation wholesale
- Namespace the package PER BATCH (`com.example.approximations.<batch>`, e.g. `...approximations.cn_hutool_001`). Every batch is loaded together into one shared index, and approximation class FQCNs must be GLOBALLY unique across all batches — two batches that both model a `…$Nested` (or any recurring simple name) in the bare `com.example.approximations` package collide on `com.example.approximations.Nested` and crash the whole scan at config-load. A per-batch package guarantees uniqueness.
- One approximation class per target class — a strict global bijection enforced at load: each approximation FQCN maps to exactly one target and vice-versa; duplicates or a reused FQCN across batches throw `IllegalArgumentException`
- Method signatures must match the target class methods exactly
- Built-in dataflow approximations are first-priority and presumed correct — you cannot override them locally
- Built-in passThrough approximations, by contrast, a user config on the same method overrides. So a coarse built-in on a *related* method — a driver that invokes the callback you modelled, a wrapper the flow passes through — can silently suppress an otherwise-correct model. When a faithful model doesn't fire, suspect a built-in on a neighbouring method and model/override that method instead; debug-rule shows which model actually applied
- Don't unpack or grep the analyzer JAR for built-in models or signatures — its internals aren't a stable API; go through the CLI
