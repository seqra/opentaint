### 1. Understand the propagation

Find and read each dataflow method's real source: take methods not yet in `build.done`, or the specific `methods` handed for repair even when already built. Leave built methods outside that explicit subset and their approximation source unchanged. An app-internal method sits in the project's own sources, a library method's source comes from its dependency (the language reference has how to get it). Read it to see how data moves from the method's inputs (receiver, arguments) to its outputs (return value, arguments it writes into, state it stores), gathering the full context needed to understand the function's behavior.

### 2. Write the approximation

Write the propagation in the batch approximation project at `.opentaint/dataflow/<batch>`. Pin each library at the version that the test project uses. Scaffold the project if it does not exist. Then write one `opentaint.<target-package>.<TargetClass>` model for each target class. Cover each assigned method and overload. Change only the requested existing methods. Add new methods to the existing model. The engine tracks taint for each field. Route data through the same fields as the source. The negative samples check this behavior. See the language reference for the code patterns.

### 3. Test against the test project

Run the approximation test directly as a foreground, blocking command and wait for exit — never background it or use Monitor. Apply this batch's sources and iterate until the samples pass. Feedback loop: a failing sample might be caused by: the model's target class or signature doesn't match what the analyzer sees, or the body doesn't route taint from the real source to the modeled output — diagnose the mismatch, fix, and re-run, don't rationalize a non-result. When the cause isn't obvious, localize where taint dies with a fact-reachability trace before guessing further per `references/debugging.md`. On a pass, append the method only if it is not already present in `build.done` (per Tracking); a repaired method remains recorded there.

### 4. Escalate

When the sample won't converge after ~3 fixes — whether the trace shows a faithful model still can't propagate (taint dying at a plain instruction the engine should carry through, an engine limitation) or the cause stays unclear — don't add a new method to `build.done` or alter an existing repaired method's tracking entry. Report it with the brief cause you found (per Output), for the orchestrator to escalate. Don't retry further.
