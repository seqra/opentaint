`.opentaint/tracking/boundaries/<family>.yaml` — one boundary family: the single universal source and single universal sink every piece of the family's evidence factors through, plus the controls that recover precision. `evidence` lists what the family was grouped from — reference finding ids in enactment mode, the members or code areas `scope.yaml` recorded otherwise. `candidate_patterns` are concrete enough for `create-rule` to test, and seed the family's source and sink units verbatim. `factorization` carries one entry per evidence item, `status` one of `covered` (factors through both boundaries as-is), `needs-restriction` (factors only under a named `context_restrictions` entry), or `unfactored` (does not factor — explain in `open_questions` and split or add a pseudo-boundary). `saturation` records the widen-and-recheck rounds and only reads `saturated` once a full round changed neither the boundaries nor any factorization. `approximation_candidates` are opaque carriers noted for later — never acted on before a scan proves the trace stops there. Keep it clear from comments
