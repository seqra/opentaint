We have dataflow based SAST analyzer. 

We have multiple configuration points:
1. Patterns in `rules/ruleset`. Vulnerable patterns to search in analyzed code. We treat all such patterns as a patterns on a dataflow trace and match them similar to the taint rules.
2. Approximations in `core/opentaint-config/config`. Default dataflow propagators for common libraries.
3. Approximations in `core/opentaint-jvm-sast-dataflow/dataflow-approximations`. Complex code-based propagators for complex methods.
4. Framework support like in `core/src/main/kotlin/org/opentaint/jvm/sast/project/spring/SpringWebProject.kt`. Special handling of frameworks.

We are trying to make all our rules and approximations customizable (e.g. via llm agent). Here are our requirements:
1. Agent should be able to generate patterns (1). We need to specialize all requirement to the pattern language
2. Agent should be able to debug and fix patterns (1). For example, fix FP or FN.
3. To work with FN, engine will return a list of external methods, where dataflow fact was killed
4. Agent should be able to generate approximations (2) and (3), mainly to fix FN
5. Approximations (2) must be hierarchical. For example, if we have rule for method `get*` and a rule for `getEntry`, the rule for `getEntry` must override the rule for `get*`
6. Approximations (3) always override (2)
7. Agent must be able to override (2) and (3)
8. Agent must be able to generate required missed approximations based on the list of external methods, where dataflow fact was killed
9. Frameworks support (4) provided as-is and is not configurable by the agent

Expected agent workflow:
1. Agent takes path to the project
2. Agent builds project via autobuilder, or create project.yaml himself (via dedicated CLI API).
3. Agent search for entry points and potentially vulnerable places
4. Agent start working on security analysis. Each step and progress is tracked in `opentaint-analysis-plan.md`
5. Agent creates Rule
6. Agent creates Tests for the rule and verify rule works as expected.
    - Take simple test sample project (like in rules/test but with few samples)
    - Write tests for designed rule
    - Run opentaint analyzer on the test like in .github/workflows/ci-rules.yaml (via dedicated CLI API)
    - Fix rule or test and repeat
7. Agent runs opentaint with Rule on the project
8. Opentaint produces 2 files:
    - Sarif with discovered vulnerabilities wrt Rule. Each vulnerability may contain multiple traces.
    - List (yaml format) with external methods, where dataflow fact was killed
9. Agent decide between the following options:
    - Fix FN according to missed external methods list. Each list entry contains info about method and fact position (pass rule from). Agent can generate more Approximations and override current, then rerun analysis.
    - Fix FN in rule (non preferred option). Add more patters and tests into Rule. Then rerun analysis.
    - Analyze trace.
      a. If trace contains FP, try fix it via Rule (e.g. pattern-not). Update rule and test, then rerun analysis
      b. If trace contains FP, try fix it via Approximations (non preferred option). Override approximation to remove impossible dataflow
      c. If trace is TP, try to generate POC. Then save it to `vulnerabilities.md`
10. Steps 7-10 are repeated until agent decides that all vulnerabilities discovered.

Analyze current analyzer impl and requirements and propose the following documents:
1. agent-mode/info/pattern-rules.md: design of all thing related to pattern rules
2. agent-mode/info/approximations-config.md: all things related to approximations
3. agent-mode/info/agent-pipeline.md: whole pipeline for the agent to work with rules, common scenarios

Consider we have opentaint installed on PATH and want to use it from the agent via skills.
We need to design the following things:
1. Changes in the opentaint that are required to match expected agent workflow
2. All opentaint operations must be available via Go CLI (implemented in Go or proxied to the Analyzer CLI)
   - Consider code-based approximations. Opentaint CLI must have an API to take approximation source code and compile it to further use it in the analysis.
3. Skills that can be used via agent. 
   - Skills must include all the required examples
   - For the rule-test skill we must provide simple sample test project
4. Meta prompt to run agent wrt expected workflow using skills. 

Write all your findings into `agent-mode/design/agent-mode-design.md`. 

No we need to design the test pipeline.
Let's start with project `/home/sobol/data/Stirling-PDF/seqra-project/project.yaml`
1. We need to test various project build scenarios
2. Check that rule generations pipeline works
3. Check approximations (including code based) generation/override
4. Check external methods extraction

Write all your findings into `agent-mode/test/agent-mode-test.md`.

No we need to understand implementation details:
1. Which modules/files will be modified and how
2. Projects structure: where skills and meta-prompt will be located
3. How skills and meta prompt will be accessible via agent? How we distribute them and provide to the end user
4. How we can test implementation without CLI installation in PATH

Write all your findings into `agent-mode/impl/agent-mode-impl.md`.

OK, WE ARE HERE. We have all required design done.

Now we can implement things. Use `agent-mode/plan.md` to track implementation process. 
Track all tasks status. If you have a new task (e.g. fix failing test) add it to the plan before start working on it.
Use git to fix project state after each task completed.

1. Make all planned changes into analyzer and CLI
2. Write skills and meta-prompt
3. Verify everything works using tests
