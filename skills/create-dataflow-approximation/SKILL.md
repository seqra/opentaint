# Skill: Create Dataflow Approximation

A dataflow approximation is code that expresses how data moves through a method the analyzer can't trace through — an opaque call where the engine loses taint because it can't see the body. You write a small stand-in that reproduces the method's real propagation from its inputs to its outputs, so the analyzer can follow taint through it. Run it against the prepared test project and refine until the sample passes.

## Inputs

Provided by the caller, fall back to the default value when omitted. Ask back only when a required input is missing and has no sensible default

- `project-root` (optional) — root of the target project. Opentaint keeps all analysis artifacts under the fixed `<project-root>/.opentaint/` directory, so every `.opentaint/...` path below resolves there. Default: current directory
- `language` (required) — target language for this project and language-specific instructions
- `batch` (required) — the batch whose `.opentaint/tracking/approximations/<batch>.yaml` provides the `dataflow` methods to model and holds tracking state
- `methods` (optional) — a specific subset of the batch's dataflow methods to (re)model; default all not yet in `build.done`

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the propagation

Find and read each dataflow method's real source: take methods not yet in `build.done`, or the specific `methods` handed for repair even when already built. Leave built methods outside that explicit subset and their approximation source unchanged. An app-internal method sits in the project's own sources, a library method's source comes from its dependency (the language reference has how to get it). Read it to see how data moves from the method's inputs (receiver, arguments) to its outputs (return value, arguments it writes into, state it stores), gathering the full context needed to understand the function's behavior.

### 2. Write the approximation

Write the propagation in the batch approximation project at `.opentaint/dataflow/<batch>`. Pin each library at the version that the test project uses. Scaffold the project if it does not exist. Then write one `opentaint.<target-package>.<TargetClass>` model for each target class. Cover each assigned method and overload. Change only the requested existing methods. Add new methods to the existing model. The engine tracks taint for each field. Route data through the same fields as the source. The negative samples check this behavior. See the language reference for the code patterns.

### 3. Test against the test project

Run the approximation test directly as a foreground, blocking command and wait for exit — never background it or use Monitor. Apply this batch's sources and iterate until the samples pass. Feedback loop: a failing sample might be caused by: the model's target class or signature doesn't match what the analyzer sees, or the body doesn't route taint from the real source to the modeled output — diagnose the mismatch, fix, and re-run, don't rationalize a non-result. When the cause isn't obvious, localize where taint dies with a fact-reachability trace before guessing further per `references/debugging.md`. On a pass, append the method only if it is not already present in `build.done` (per Tracking); a repaired method remains recorded there.

### 4. Escalate

When the sample won't converge after ~3 fixes — whether the trace shows a faithful model still can't propagate (taint dying at a plain instruction the engine should carry through, an engine limitation) or the cause stays unclear — don't add a new method to `build.done` or alter an existing repaired method's tracking entry. Report it with the brief cause you found (per Output), for the orchestrator to escalate. Don't retry further.

## Output

### Artifacts

- `.opentaint/dataflow/<batch>` contains the approximation project and its pinned dependencies. It contains one `opentaint.<target-package>.<TargetClass>` model for each target class. Report the path and the exact test command.
- `build.done` lists the methods that pass. Add new methods. Do not change existing entries for repaired methods.

### Summary

- the methods modeled and the test status (passing / non-converging)

## Tracking

`.opentaint/tracking/approximations/<batch>.yaml` — one batch's method classification, `<batch>` the plan's filename stem. Every method sits in exactly one verdict bucket, keyed with its `signature` (the JVM descriptor, always quoted so array types `[…` stay valid YAML) so overloads stay distinct:
- `passthrough`, `dataflow` — modeled carriers; each entry `{ method, signature }`
- `skipped` — terminal non-carriers; each `{ method, signature, reason }`
- `engine_issues` — a separate bucket for carriers the engine provably can't propagate (built but still dropped); each `{ method, signature, reason }`. Terminal and treated just like `skipped` — the only difference is the reason. `merge-skipped` carries it into `skipped.yaml` as its own `engine_issues` group alongside the regular skipped `methods`.

`dependencies` lists the dependency identifiers a dataflow test project needs. The `build` block tracks the build — `test_project` records each dataflow method's test-project status (`done` if a sample was written into the batch's test project, `failed` if none could be written so the method was excluded from it), and `done` holds the finished `{ method, signature }`. Keep it clear from comments

```yaml
passthrough:
  - { method: "com.foo.Wrapper#getValue", signature: "()Ljava/lang/String;" }
dataflow:
  - { method: "com.foo.Reactor#flatMap", signature: "(Ljava/util/function/Function;)Lcom/foo/Reactor;" }
skipped:
  - { method: "org.slf4j.Logger#info", signature: "(Ljava/lang/String;)V", reason: "void side-effect" }
engine_issues: []
dependencies: []
build:
  test_project:
    - { method: "com.foo.Reactor#flatMap", signature: "(Ljava/util/function/Function;)Lcom/foo/Reactor;", status: done }
  done: []
```

This skill appends each method whose sample passes to `build.done` as `{ method, signature }` when absent. A newly assigned method that still fails, or one the engine provably can't propagate, stays out and is reported (per Output); an explicitly repaired method leaves its existing entry unchanged. Don't touch the classification buckets (`passthrough`/`dataflow`/`skipped`/`engine_issues`) or edit an entry already in `build.done`.

## Constraints

OpenTaint is a whole-program, interprocedural, field-sensitive alias analysis engine. It already propagates through visible application code, calls, aliases, and individual fields; custom rules and approximations model only the assigned source, sink, or opaque-method boundary. Compile-time constants and literals carry no taint, so a source or carrier whose output is only a constant introduces nothing.

- Verify only with the approximation test on the test project
- The test project's sample sources are a fixed input — never edit or recompile them to force a pass; if a faithful model can't pass, leave the method out and report it (per Output)
- Model every dataflow method and overload the batch lists, not only the ones you have a sample for
