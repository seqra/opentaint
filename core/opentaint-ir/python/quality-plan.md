## Q2: Fix Bugs Found in Analysis
- [x] Fix exception type resolution in try/except (was hardcoded to `builtins.Exception`)
- [x] Fix for-loop tuple unpacking target (was only handling NameExpr, now emits PIRUnpack for TupleExpr)
- [x] Add `__exit__` call emission in `with` statement handler (was missing entirely)
- [x] Add logging to catch-all exception handlers in module_builder.py (was silently swallowing)
- [x] Fix function qualified_name for methods (now `module.Class.method` instead of `module.method`)
- [x] Fix RecursionError in type_mapper.py for recursive types (added depth limit)
- [x] Fix int overflow for huge Python ints in protobuf (int64 can't hold 2^64+)
- [x] Add assert message support (emit call with message argument)
- [x] Fix `with` statement to use load_attr __enter__/__exit__ pattern (was using fake $__enter__ local)
- [x] Fix exception handler labels on try-body blocks (blocks inside try had empty exceptionHandlers)
- [x] Fix mid-block terminators: dead code after return/raise emitted in same basic block
- [x] Fix for/else and while/else: break target was same block as else body, causing dead code
- [x] Fix with-stmt `__exit__` dead code: skip `__exit__` when body terminates with return/raise
- [x] Fix chained comparison lowering (DC-18: uses BIT_AND → short-circuit branching)
- [x] Wire up PIRProperty in MypyModuleBuilder (DC-19: getter/setter/deleter extraction)

## Q3: Add More Complex CFG Tests

- [x] Comprehension round-trip tests (39 tests in RoundTripComprehensionTest)
- [x] Lambda round-trip tests (30 tests in RoundTripLambdaTest)
- [x] WalrusOperatorTest (17 tests) — walrus in if, while, comp, ternary, assert, nested, condition chain

- [x] CfgIntegrityTest (33 tests) — structural CFG validation (reachability, successor/predecessor consistency, terminator checks, dangling edges, block label uniqueness)
- [x] EdgeCasesTest (40 tests) — edge-case coverage (empty functions, deep nesting, all comparison operators, delete stmts, parameter kinds, assert patterns, try/except variants)
- [x] 12 new Tier-3 round-trip tests (while-break, for-continue, augmented assign, nested if, chained if, power, find-max, count-chars, nested loops, early return, build dict)
- [x] 360 new Tier-3 round-trip tests across 8 new test classes (RoundTripArithmeticTest, RoundTripStringTest, RoundTripConditionalTest, RoundTripLoopTest, RoundTripCollectionTest, RoundTripMixedTest, RoundTripComprehensionTest, RoundTripLambdaTest)
- [x] Stronger benchmark assertions (instruction diversity, 0 dangling edges, <10% unreachable blocks)
- [x] Refactored 4 slow test classes to PER_CLASS lifecycle (BasicInstructionsTest, ClassesTest, ExceptionHandlingTest, TypeMappingTest)
- [x] RoundTripExceptionTest (53 tests) — try/except/else/finally, nested try, try-in-loop, break/continue in except, multi-handler
- [x] RoundTripWalrusTest (31 tests) — walrus in if/while/ternary, nested walrus, arithmetic patterns
- [x] RoundTripAdvancedTest (40 tests) — chained comparisons, augmented chains, ternary chains, complex boolean, collection building
- [x] Enhanced PIRReconstructor to wrap exception-handler blocks in try/except for correct round-trip behavior

## Progress Log

### Session 3 (Quality Phase)
- Expanded Tier-1 benchmarks from 4 to 19 real-world packages
- Fixed 9 bugs in Python lowering code:
  - Exception type resolution (try/except)
  - For-loop tuple unpacking
  - With-statement __enter__/__exit__ protocol
  - Function qualified name for methods
  - RecursionError in type_mapper (recursive types)

- Added 4 new Tier-2 test classes (77 new tests)
- Added CFG quality assertions to benchmark tests
- All 232 tests pass (19 Tier-1, 203 Tier-2, 10 Tier-3)

### Session 4 (Quality Phase continued)
- Fixed bug: exception handler labels not set on try-body blocks (DC-9)
  - Blocks inside `try` body now get correct `exceptionHandlers` pointing to except handler blocks
  - Root cause: block finalization happened after handler stack was restored
  - Fix: explicitly finalize try-body block before restoring old handler stack
- Added CfgIntegrityTest (33 tests): structural CFG validation
  - All blocks reachable from entry (dead merge blocks allowed)
  - Successor/predecessor consistency (bidirectional)
  - Exit blocks end with return/raise/unreachable
  - No dangling edges (all goto/branch/nextiter targets resolve)
  - Block labels are unique, entry exists in blocks list
  - Exception handler labels all resolve to existing blocks
- Added EdgeCasesTest (40 tests): edge-case coverage
  - Empty/minimal functions, deep nesting (5-level if, 4-level loops)
  - Multi-target assignment, tuple swap
  - Try-in-try, try/except/else/finally, multi-except, raise-from
  - while-True-break, nested-break-continue, for-in-while
  - All comparison operators (is, is not, in, not in)
  - f-strings, class methods (static/class/instance), globals
  - Assert with/without message, delete (local/attr/subscript)
  - Parameter kinds (VAR_POSITIONAL, VAR_KEYWORD, KEYWORD_ONLY)
- Added 12 new Tier-3 round-trip tests: while-break, for-continue, augmented assign, nested-if, multi-assign, chained-if, power, find-max, count-chars, nested-while-loops, early-return, build-dict
- Strengthened Tier-1 benchmark assertions: instruction diversity (>=3 types), 0 dangling edges, <10% unreachable blocks
- Refactored 4 slow test classes to PER_CLASS lifecycle (12x speedup per class)
- All 317 tests pass (19 Tier-1, 276 Tier-2, 22 Tier-3)

### Session 5 (Quality Phase continued)
- Found and fixed 3 bugs via systematic scanning of 18 benchmark packages:
  - DC-10: Mid-block terminators — dead code after return/raise in basic blocks
    - Root cause: `_visit_block` didn't stop emitting after a terminator
    - Also: `_visit_with` emitted `__exit__` after a return in the body
    - Scanned all 18 packages: 5 affected functions reduced to 0
  - DC-11: for/else and while/else break target
    - Break went to same block as else body, causing dead code when else returned
    - Fix: separate `break_block` (after else) from `exit_block` (else body)
  - DC-12: with-stmt `__exit__` dead code
    - `__exit__` was emitted after return in with body, creating mid-block terminator
    - Fix: skip `__exit__` emission when body is already terminated
- Added 4 new tests to CfgIntegrityTest for mid-block terminator detection
- Updated existing tests to use non-returning with bodies for `__exit__` checks
- All 321 tests pass (19 Tier-1, 280 Tier-2, 22 Tier-3)

### Session 6
- Propagated CFG build failures via protobuf diagnostics (replaces stderr logging)
  - Added PIRDiagnosticProto to proto schema with severity, message, function_name, exception_type
  - Added diagnostics field to PIRModuleProto, PIRModule interface, PIRModuleImpl
  - Module builder populates diagnostics instead of printing to stderr
- Implemented lambda lowering
  - LambdaExpr builds CFG using same FuncItem infrastructure as FuncDef
  - Generates synthetic <lambda>$N functions registered in module
  - Verified: click 5 lambdas, requests 1, rich 10, mypy 29
- Implemented comprehension lowering
  - List: [expr for x in iter if cond] -> loop with list.append
  - Set: {expr ...} -> loop with set.add
  - Dict: {k:v ...} -> loop with dict[k] = v
  - Supports nested loops and multiple filter conditions
  - Generator expressions materialized as lists
- Verified class hierarchies and MRO across real packages
  - Single/multiple inheritance, diamond patterns, C3 linearization all correct
  - Enum detection, dataclass detection working
  - Base classes fully qualified
- Fixed 3 additional bugs (DC-10/11/12 from session 5):
  - Mid-block terminators from dead code
  - for/else and while/else break targets
  - with-stmt __exit__ dead code
- All 302 tests pass (19 Tier-1, 258 Tier-2, 22 Tier-3 + 3 untagged)

- Total: 632 tests (19 Tier-1, 258 Tier-2, 352 Tier-3 + 3 untagged)

### Session 8
- Added lambda round-trip support to PIRReconstructor:
  - New `reconstructWithLambdas()` method resolves synthetic `<lambda>$N` functions from classpath
  - Lambda functions are emitted as regular `def` blocks with sanitized names
  - `sanitizeFuncName()` converts `<lambda>$0` -> `__lambda___0` for valid Python identifiers

  - Added ping retry with shorter deadline (5 retries × 10s, backoff)
  - Added `shutdownNow()` fallback for channel cleanup
- Bug fixes:
  - DC-13: Decorated method qualified names wrong — `buildFunction` used proto fullname (wrong for Decorator nodes) instead of enclosingClass-based name
  - DC-14: `enclosingClass` back-reference not set on PIRFunctionImpl for class methods
  - DC-15: AST serializer RecursionError on deeply nested expressions (idna package) — added depth limit (MAX_EXPR_DEPTH=40) with try/catch per definition
  - DC-16: Python server orphan process issue — added stdin watchdog thread + stdin pipe close on process manager shutdown
  - DC-17: Thread pool too small (was 1 worker) — increased to 4 workers
