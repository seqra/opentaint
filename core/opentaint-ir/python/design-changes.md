# Design Changes Log

This document tracks deviations from the original design and bugs discovered during quality testing.

## Changes

### DC-1: Exception Type Resolution in try/except
**Original design**: Hardcoded `builtins.Exception` for all except clause types.
**Problem**: All exception handlers appeared to catch the generic `Exception`, making exception-type-specific taint tracking impossible.
**Fix**: Added `_resolve_except_types()` method to `statement_visitor.py` that resolves `NameExpr` and `MemberExpr` exception types to their fully qualified names using mypy's symbol resolution. Handles tuple `except (A, B)` by recursing into each element.
**File**: `pir_server/builder/statement_visitor.py`

### DC-10: Mid-Block Terminators (Dead Code After return/raise)
**Original design**: `_visit_block()` visited all statements sequentially without checking if the current block was already terminated.
**Problem**: When a block contained a `return` or `raise` followed by more statements (e.g., `raise ValueError(...); x = 1` inside a `try` body, or `return` inside a `with` body followed by `__exit__` calls), the dead code was emitted into the same basic block after the terminator. This violates the basic block invariant that a terminator must be the last instruction.
**Impact**: Downstream analyses could misinterpret instructions after a terminator as reachable, producing incorrect data flow.
**Fix**: Added `_current_block_terminated()` check in `_visit_block()` loop — stops emitting statements after a terminator. Also added early return in `_visit_with()` when the body is terminated, preventing dead `__exit__` calls after a return.
**File**: `pir_server/builder/statement_visitor.py`

### DC-11: for/else and while/else Break Target
**Original design**: In `_visit_for()` and `_visit_while()`, the `break_target` was the same block as the `exit_block` where the `else` body was visited.
**Problem**: When the `else` body contained a `return`, the exit block was terminated. Then code after the for/while statement (which is reachable via the `break` path) was skipped because `_visit_block` saw the block was terminated. This caused the after-loop code to be lost.
**Fix**: For `for/else` and `while/else`, separate the `break_block` (after the else, where post-loop code goes) from the `else_block` (where the else body is visited). Break goes to `break_block`, normal loop exit goes to `else_block`. After visiting the else body, if it didn't terminate, emit a goto to `break_block`.
**File**: `pir_server/builder/statement_visitor.py`

### DC-12: with-stmt `__exit__` Dead Code
**Original design**: `_visit_with()` always emitted `__exit__` calls after visiting the body, regardless of whether the body terminated.
**Problem**: When the `with` body contained a `return` or `raise`, the `__exit__` calls were emitted after the terminator in the same basic block, creating dead code and violating the basic block invariant.
**Fix**: After visiting the body, check `_current_block_terminated()`. If true, skip `__exit__` emission entirely (the calls would be unreachable anyway).
**File**: `pir_server/builder/statement_visitor.py`

### DC-3: For-Loop Tuple Unpacking
**Original design**: `_lower_for_target` only handled `NameExpr` targets. For `for a, b in items:`, the tuple elements `a` and `b` were never assigned.
**Problem**: For-loop iteration variables in tuple unpacking patterns were invisible to the IR.
**Fix**: Added `_emit_for_target_unpack()` method. When the for-loop target is a `TupleExpr`, a temp variable receives the `next_iter` result, then a `PIRUnpack` instruction unpacks it into the individual variables.
**File**: `pir_server/builder/statement_visitor.py`

### DC-4: Function Qualified Names for Methods
**Original design**: Method qualified names were `module.method_name`, same as top-level functions.
**Problem**: `MyClass.foo` and a module-level `foo` would have the same qualified name, causing lookup collisions.
**Fix**: Added `enclosing_class` parameter to `_build_function()`. When set, qualified names become `module.ClassName.method_name`.
**File**: `pir_server/builder/module_builder.py`

### DC-5: Recursive Type Mapping Overflow
**Original design**: `TypeMapper.map()` had no recursion guard.
**Problem**: Some Python types (e.g., `packaging.version._BaseVersion`) have recursive type parameters that cause infinite recursion in `type_mapper.py`, crashing the entire analysis with `RecursionError`.
**Fix**: Added depth counter with `MAX_DEPTH = 10`. When exceeded, returns `PIRAnyType` as a safe fallback. Split into `map()` (guard) + `_map_inner()` (actual logic).
**File**: `pir_server/builder/type_mapper.py`

### DC-6: Integer Overflow for Large Python Constants
**Original design**: Python `int` values were directly assigned to protobuf `int64` field.
**Problem**: Python supports arbitrary-precision integers (e.g., `2**64` in `more_itertools`), but protobuf `int64` maxes at `2^63 - 1`. Values exceeding this caused `ValueError: Value out of range`.
**Fix**: Added range check in `_const_int()`. Values within int64 range use `int_value`; larger values fall back to `string_value` representation.
**File**: `pir_server/builder/expression_visitor.py`

### DC-7: Silent Exception Swallowing in CFG Building
**Original design**: `_build_function()` and `_build_module_init()` caught all exceptions silently, replacing the CFG with a stub.
**Problem**: Bugs in the lowering code were completely hidden, making quality analysis impossible.
**Fix**: Added `sys.stderr` logging with the function name, exception type, and message. The stub CFG is still used as fallback, but the failure is now visible.
**File**: `pir_server/builder/module_builder.py`

### DC-8: Assert Message Support
**Original design**: `_visit_assert` ignored `stmt.msg`.
**Problem**: `assert condition, "message"` lost the message argument.
**Fix**: When `stmt.msg` is present, the message is lowered and emitted as a `PIRCall` to the `AssertionError` constructor with the message as a positional argument.
**File**: `pir_server/builder/statement_visitor.py`

### DC-9: Exception Handler Labels Not Set on Try-Body Blocks
**Original design**: `_visit_try` set `current_exception_handlers` before visiting the try body, then restored it after. The intent was that `_finalize_current_block()` would stamp the handler labels onto each block as it was created.
**Problem**: The try body's blocks were only finalized when the next `_activate()` call happened (for handler blocks). By that time, `current_exception_handlers` had already been restored to the outer scope's handlers. Result: all blocks inside `try` bodies had `exceptionHandlers = []`, making exception flow invisible to the IR.
**Impact**: For taint analysis, this meant that exception-handler-mediated data flow (e.g., `except ValueError as e:` capturing tainted data) was structurally disconnected from the try body that produced the exception.
**Fix**: Two changes to `_visit_try()`:
1. Before setting exception handlers, activate a new block for the try body (so pre-try instructions are finalized without handlers).
2. After visiting the try body (and emitting the goto-to-end terminator), explicitly call `_finalize_current_block()` before restoring old handlers. This ensures the try body's last block gets the correct handler labels stamped on it.

### DC-13: Decorated Method Qualified Names
**Original design**: `MypyModuleBuilder.buildFunction()` used `funcDef.fullname` from the proto if non-empty, falling back to `enclosingClass`-based construction only when fullname was empty.
**Problem**: The Python AST serializer's `_serialize_decorator_def()` called `_serialize_func_def(dec.func)` without passing `enclosing_class`. So for `@staticmethod def static_method(y):` inside `ECClass`, the func's fullname became `__test__.static_method` (no class prefix). The Kotlin builder then used this wrong fullname from the proto, making methods invisible to `findFunctionOrNull("__test__.ECClass.static_method")`.
**Fix**: In `buildFunction()`, check `enclosingClass != null` first and always construct the qualified name from it when present, regardless of what the proto's fullname says.
**File**: `opentaint-ir-impl-python/builder/MypyModuleBuilder.kt`

### DC-14: enclosingClass Back-Reference Not Set
**Original design**: `buildFunction()` always set `enclosingClass = null` in the returned `PIRFunctionImpl`, even for class methods.
**Problem**: Tests checking `method.enclosingClass` got null for all methods.
**Fix**: Changed `PIRFunctionImpl.enclosingClass` from `val` to `var`. After building a `PIRClassImpl` with its methods list, loop through methods and set `method.enclosingClass = cls`.
**Files**: `PIRImplData.kt`, `MypyModuleBuilder.kt`

### DC-15: AST Serializer RecursionError on Deep Expressions
**Original design**: `_serialize_expr()` had no depth limit, recursing into nested expressions without bound.
**Problem**: The `idna` package contains deeply nested `OpExpr` chains (e.g., `a | b | c | ...` with 40+ levels). This caused both Python RecursionError and protobuf `DecodeError` (protobuf has a ~100-level nesting limit).
**Fix**: Added `MAX_EXPR_DEPTH = 40` instance counter to `_serialize_expr()`. When exceeded, returns empty `MypyExprProto`. Also added try/catch per definition in `serialize()` to skip (with warning) any definition that fails serialization.
**File**: `pir_server/builder/ast_serializer.py`

### DC-16: Python Server Orphan Process
**Original design**: The Python gRPC server had no mechanism to detect when its parent (Kotlin JVM) process died.
**Problem**: If the JVM crashed or was killed without calling `Shutdown` RPC, the Python server remained running indefinitely, consuming resources.
**Fix**: Added `_parent_watchdog()` thread that monitors `sys.stdin.buffer.read()`. When the parent dies, stdin returns EOF, triggering `server.stop()` + `os._exit(0)`. Also added `proc.outputStream.close()` in Kotlin's `PIRProcessManager.close()` to trigger the watchdog on graceful shutdown.
**Files**: `pir_server/server.py`, `PIRProcessManager.kt`

### DC-17: IPv4/IPv6 Connection Mismatch
**Original design**: Python gRPC server bound to `localhost:{port}`.
**Problem**: On systems with IPv6, `localhost` resolves to both `127.0.0.1` (IPv4) and `::1` (IPv6). The Python server sometimes bound to IPv6 `::1` while the Kotlin gRPC client connected to IPv4 `127.0.0.1`. This caused intermittent `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` connection failures that were non-deterministic and appeared only under load (rapid process creation/destruction).
**Fix**: Changed server to bind explicitly to `127.0.0.1:{port}` instead of `localhost:{port}`. Kotlin client already used `forAddress("localhost", port)` which resolves to IPv4.
**File**: `pir_server/server.py`

### DC-18: Chained Comparison Short-Circuit
**Original design**: Chained comparisons like `a < b < c` were lowered using `BIT_AND` to combine individual comparisons: `(a < b) & (b < c)`.
**Problem**: `BIT_AND` is not short-circuit — it evaluates both operands even when the first is false. Python's semantics require short-circuit evaluation: if `a < b` is false, `b < c` should not be evaluated. This matters for side effects and when operand evaluation is expensive.
**Fix**: Changed `visitComparison()` in `ExpressionLowering.kt` to use short-circuit branching pattern (same as `visitShortCircuit` for `and`/`or`). Each chained comparison pair creates a branch: if false, jump to end block; if true, continue to next pair. Result variable is assigned after each comparison.
**File**: `opentaint-ir-impl-python/src/main/kotlin/org/opentaint/ir/impl/python/builder/ExpressionLowering.kt`

### DC-19: PIRProperty Not Wired Up
**Original design**: `PIRProperty` interface defined in API with getter/setter/deleter fields, but `MypyModuleBuilder.buildClass()` created an empty properties list.
**Problem**: Property getter/setter/deleter were not accessible via the `PIRProperty` API, only as raw methods with `isProperty=true` on the getter. Setters and deleters were not extracted at all because `_unwrap_func()` on `OverloadedFuncDef` only took `items[0]` (the getter).
**Fix**: Two-part fix:
1. Python AST serializer: Changed `_serialize_definition()` to `_serialize_definitions()` returning a list, and for `OverloadedFuncDef` serialize ALL items (getter + setter + deleter), not just the first. Also pass `enclosing_class` through `_serialize_decorator_def`.
2. Kotlin MypyModuleBuilder: After building all class methods, group property methods by name. Getter detected by `isProperty=true` flag, setter by having more params than getter (`self + value` vs `self`), deleter by same params as getter but appearing after it.
**Files**: `pir_server/builder/ast_serializer.py`, `opentaint-ir-impl-python/src/main/kotlin/org/opentaint/ir/impl/python/builder/MypyModuleBuilder.kt`

### DC-20: Local Function Extraction with Closure Variable Capture
**Original design**: Nested functions inside function bodies were silently skipped by CfgBuilder. No PIRFunction was created for them.
**Problem**: Code patterns like closures, factory functions, and local helpers were completely lost in the IR — the inner function's body was invisible, and calls to it were unresolved.
**Fix**: Multi-component fix:
1. **CfgBuilder**: Added `visitNestedFuncDef()` — when encountering a FuncDef statement, extracts it via `MypyModuleBuilder.extractNestedFunction()` and emits `local = GlobalRef(uniqueName)`.
2. **MypyModuleBuilder**: Added `extractNestedFunction()` that builds a fresh CFG for the inner function, assigns a unique name (`funcName$localN`), and appends to `nestedFunctions` list (module-level, like lambdas).
3. **Python AST serializer**: Added `_collect_free_vars()` that analyzes nested function bodies to identify captured variables (free variables not in params/locals/builtins). Populates `closure_vars` on the proto.
4. **PIRReconstructor**: Implements env-dict pattern for closure variable passing:
   - Inner functions with captures receive `__env__` dict as first parameter
   - Captured variable reads/writes become `__env__['name']`
   - Outer function creates `__env__ = {}`, seeds with captured params
   - Call sites inject `__env__` as first arg for functions with captures
   - After calls, reads back captured vars from `__env__` (for nonlocal writes)
5. **Default parameter values**: Added `default_value` field to `PIRParameterProto` and `PIRParameter` API. `evalConstExpr()` evaluates constant AST expressions to PIRValueProto.
**Limitations**: Multi-level nesting (function inside function inside function) not yet supported in round-trip reconstruction (5 tests).
